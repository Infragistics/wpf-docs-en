== Binding Field and FieldLayout Objects to DataContext

[[_Hlk368069110]]

=== Overview

Use the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.field_members.html[Field]/ link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayout_members.html[FieldLayout] `DataContext` property to facilitate the MVVM binding.

By default, if the `Field`/`FieldLayout` `DataContext` property is not explicitly set, it takes the  _xamDataPresenter_   control’s `DataContext`.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

== Binding Field, FieldSettings, FieldLayout and FieldLayoutSettings to MVVM Properties

=== Overview

Use the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldbinding_members.html[FieldBinding] markup extension to facilitate the binding of link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.field_members.html[Field], link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldsettings_members.html[FieldSettings], link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayout_members.html[FieldLayout] and link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayoutsettings_members.html[FieldLayoutSettings] to MVVM properties.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The `FieldBinding` exposes the same options as `Binding` except it doesn’t expose the following properties:

* `AsyncState`
* `BindingGroupName`
* `BindsDirectlyToSource`
* `Delay`
* `ElementName`
* `IsAsync`
* `RelativeSource`
* `Source`
* `ValidatesOnDataErrors`
* `ValidatesOnExceptions`
* `ValidatesOnNotifyDataErrors`
* `ValidationRules`
* `XPath`

====

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The `FieldBinding` markup extension throws a `XamlParseException` if it is used on an object other that a `Field` or a `FieldLayout` or when it is bound to a property of type `BindingBase` (for example - `Field`’s `AlternateBinding` property).
====

=== Example

The binding to MVVM properties can be implemented in any one of the following ways:

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<igDP:Field  Name="Name" Label="{igDP:FieldBinding MyProperty}" />
----

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<igDP:Field Name="Name" Label="{Binding Path=Owner.DataPresenter.DataContext. MyProperty, RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self}}"  />
----

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<igDP:Field Name="Name" Label="{Binding Path=DataContext.MyProperty, RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self}}"  />
----
