[[_Ref382933036]]

=== Changes in item filtering implementation and renamed properties

In order to enhance the custom item filtering in the control, the following properties were changed:

* `ItemsFilter`
* `CustomItemsFilter`

Till the 2014 Volume 1 release, only one filter was possible to apply in the control. After creating an `ItemsFilter` object, it was set to the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xamcomboeditor{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.xamcomboeditor_members.html[XamComboEditor]/ link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xamcomboeditor{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.xammulticolumncomboeditor_members.html[XamMultiColumnComboEditor] `CustomItemsFilter` property.

After enhancing the custom item filtering logic, it is possible to create many filters of type link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xamcomboeditor{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.comboitemfilter_members.html[ComboItemFilter] and they are added to the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xamcomboeditor{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.xamcomboeditor_members.html[XamComboEditor]/ link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xamcomboeditor{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.xammulticolumncomboeditor_members.html[XamMultiColumnComboEditor] link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xamcomboeditor{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.comboeditorbase`2~itemfilters.html[ItemFilters] property of type `ObservableCollection<ComboItemFilter>.`

.Note
[NOTE]
====
When creating a custom `ComboItemFilter`, the `ComboItemFilter` link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xamcomboeditor{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.comboitemfilter~fieldname.html[FieldName] property must be set to the name of the data property to be filtered. If `FieldName` property is not set, an exception is thrown.
====

Following is a table that lists the old properties names and the new ones:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Old Property Name|New Property Name

|Infragistics.Controls.Editors.ItemsFilter
|Infragistics.Controls.Editors.ComboItemFilter

|Infragistics.Controls.Editors.CustomItemsFilter
|Infragistics.Controls.Editors.ItemFilters
