=== SelectedColorChanged Event Change

Until Infragistics WPF 2014 Volume 2 Release, the _xamColorPicker_ `SelectedColorChanged` event was triggered every time a user hovers over a color in the _xamColorPicker_ palettes.

Now the `SelectedColorChanged` event is triggered only when the user selects a color with mouse click.

=== Deprecating the UboundField Type

The `UnboundField` field type is now deprecated and you should refrain from using it. Instead you should use the new editor specific field types (or the common `Field` type) and set the new `BindingType` property to `Unbound`.

|Old Field Definition|New Field Definition
