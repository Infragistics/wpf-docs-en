[[_Ref421542580]]
== TriangulationSource

[[_Ref421542581]]

=== TriangulationSource class moved to shared assembly

The location for the link:{ApiPlatform}datavisualization{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.triangulationsource.html[TriangulationSource] class has been removed from the xamGeographicMap assembly and has been moved to the shared DataVisualization assembly.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Old Assembly|New Assembly

|{ApiPlatform}Controls.Maps.XamGeographicMap
|{ApiPlatform}DataVisualization

|====

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The namespace for the TriangulationSource class has not changed; further, as the DataVisualization assembly was already required for the xamGeographicMap, no further actions are necessary for prior implementations.

[[_Ref421542576]]
== xamDataPresenter

[[_Ref421542577]]

=== Default property value change

The default value of the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayoutsettings~allowfieldmoving.html[AllowFieldMoving] property is changed from `Yes` to `WithinLogicalRow`.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|Property|Old Visibility|New Visibility

|`AllowFieldMoving`
|`Yes`
|`WithinLogicalRow`

|====

*Workaround:*

If you want to retain the old behavior you can set `AllowFieldMoving` property to `Yes`.

=== Fields collection's items not accessible

You may not be able to access fields defined in XAML using the `FieldLayout`{empty}'s `Fields` collection prior the initialization of the particular field layout (for example this may not be possible in the _xamDataGrid's_ `Loaded` event).

*Workarounds:*

. You may use the `FieldLayout`{empty}'s `FieldItems` collection which contains the fields definitions prior the `FieldLayout` is initialized. Since the `FieldItems` collection is using the `FieldItem` type you may need to up-cast to the `Field` type in order to access the `Field` specific properties.

. You may use the _xamDataGrid's_ `FieldLayoutInitialized` event to get notified for the moment in time at which a specific `FieldLayout` gets initialized which means its `Fields` and `FieldItems` collections are populated and synchronized.

=== ShoulKeepResourcesOnUnload public property name has been changed

The name of the  _xamGeographicMap’s_   link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xamgeographicmap~shouldkeepresourcesonunload.html[ShouldKeepResourcesOnUnload] property has been changed.

[[_Ref421542579]]

=== Change in the default visibility of the recurrence label

The default visibility of the recurrence label in the xamSchedule's recurrence dialog is now visible for German and French languages.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]

*Workaround:*

If you want to retain the old behavior you can add a string resource which configures the visibility to a resource file (.resx) and register this resource file on any of the xamSchedule's views as described in the related topic below.
