== Configuring Custom TAB Navigation

[[_Hlk368069110]]

=== Overview

Using the `TAB` keyboard button, you can navigate through all the cells in the  _xamDataPresenter_   controls.

You can exclude a particular link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.cell_members.html[Cell] or link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.field_members.html[Field] from `TAB` navigation, using the `IsTabStop` property. This doesn’t affect records filtering and adding new records.

The default value of this property is null which resolves to `true`.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The `Cell` `IsTabStop` property value overrides its Field `IsTabStop` and `IsTabStopInAddRecord` settings.
====

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired behavior to the property settings that manage it.
