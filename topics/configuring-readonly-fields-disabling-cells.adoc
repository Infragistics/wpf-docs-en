== Configuring Read-only Field

[[_Hlk368069110]]

=== Overview

In some cases, you may want to prevent the user from editing `Field` data through the UI in the  _xamDataPresenter_   controls. In order to do that, set the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.field_members.html[Field] `IsReadOnly` property to `true`.

Note that, you still can modify the editor’s value through code.

The default value of the `IsReadOnly` property is `null` which resolves to false.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

|Set a `Field` as read-only
| link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.field~isreadonly.html[IsReadOnly]
|`true`
