== Creating Custom Tuned Theme

[[_Ref318799988]]

=== Introduction

This procedure describes the necessary steps for creating and applying custom color tuned themes for specific application level Infragistics® controls.

[[_Ref318799994]]

=== Requirements

To complete this procedure, you need to have a working project using Infragistics controls. You can easily create one following the link:xamgrid-adding-xamgrid-to-your-page.html[Adding xamGrid to Your Page] topic.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
To use Infragistics Color Tuner, you need a project with Infragistics assemblies. This walkthrough uses a `xamGrid` control to display the Infragistics Color Tuner's usage. Using the same approach, you can apply color tuning to any Infragistics control.

This tutorial uses  _xamGrid_  ,  _xamMenu_   and  _xamDockManager_  , so you can select Metro.xamGrid.xaml, Metro.xamMenu.xaml and Metro.xamDockManager.xaml from the list.

[start=2]
. To confirm, click the Apply button.
