== Introduction

=== Introduction to the xamDataGrid external sorting, filtering, grouping and summaries

XamDataGrid feature for external sorting, filtering, grouping and summaries allows you to offload those operations to an external source. By default, sorting, filtering, grouping and summary calculations are performed internally by the data presenter. Although the internal processing allows data presenter to integrate tightly those operations with its’ own object model and UI, there are advantages for performing those operations externally.

|Cases|Description

|Avoiding performance impact in terms of memory allocation
|The internal process of sorting, filtering, grouping and summary calculations requires the data presenter to allocate `DataRecord` objects for all of the data items that are part of the operation. 

This can have an adverse performance impact in terms of memory allocation as well as initial CPU time taken by the process of allocation of the data record objects. 

One advantage of performing the operations externally is better performance.

|Using native XamDataGrid UI with external data source
|With external process the data source inherits ICollectionView, any sorting, filtering and grouping operations performed on the view can be reflected in the UI of the data presenter. 

Any changes made to sort, filter or grouping criteria through the data presenter UI will be reflected in the underlying link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644316[ICollectionView] as well.

|Bound `ICollectionView` instance to other View control
|You can bind the same `ICollectionView` instance to other view controls. This will reflect the sorting, filtering and grouping criteria applied via data presenter UI.

|Data Presenter will synchronize its link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayout~sortedfields.html[SortedFields] when link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.icollectionview.sortdescriptions[SortDescriptions] and/or link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.icollectionview.groupdescriptions[GroupDescriptions] are modified externally
|When the `SortDescription` and `GroupDescriptions` of `ICollectionView` are modified externally, the data presenter will be notified of the changes and synchronize its `SortedFields` collection to reflect the changes. 

.Note 

[NOTE] 

==== 

Only the root field’s layout support external processing and not child field layouts, as there are multiple collection views for a child field layout. 

====

|Performing operations remotely
|It is possible to perform sorting, filtering, grouping and summary calculations on a server. The function of the data presenter will be to show the results only, and its UI will be used for generating the commands for sorting, filtering, grouping and summaries on the server.
