= Infragistics Standard Error Calculator

This topic introduces the link:{ApiPlatform}math.calculators{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.calculators.standarderrorcalculator.html[StandardErrorCalculator] which is part of the link:{ApiPlatform}math.calculators{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.calculators_namespace.html[Infragistics Math Calculators]™ library and explains, with code examples, how to use it to calculate link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error_(statistics)[standard error] for a set of numbers.

== Overview

The topic is organized as follows:

* <<Introduction,Introduction>>
* <<StandardErrorFormula,Standard Error Formula>>
* <<StandardErrorCalculatorProperties,Standard Error Calculator Properties>>
* <<Requirements,Requirements>>

** Assembly Requirements
** Data Requirements

== Introduction

link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error_(statistics)[Standard error] estimates is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. The standard error of a sample depends on the sample size and the larger the size of sample the smaller the standard error.

== Standard Error Formula

In sample statistics, standard error is computed by dividing the link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#With_sample_standard_deviation[sample standard deviation] by the square root of the size of sample (the total count of numbers). The samples standard deviation is computed by taking square root of the sum of squared differences between the variables and the the mean (refer to the link:ig-calculators-mean-calculator.html[Infragistics Mean Calculator] topic) divided by one less than the total count of numbers in the data set.

== Standard Error Calculator Properties

This section provides a list of properties of the link:{ApiPlatform}math.calculators{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.calculators.standarderrorcalculator.html[StandardErrorCalculator] class.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|Property Name|Property Type|Description

|ItemsSource
| link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[IEnumerable]
|Gets or sets the source of data items for the calculator.

|ValueMemberPath
|string
|Gets or sets the Value member path of a data item. This property must be mapped to a name of numeric property of a data item.

|Value
|double
|Gets the value of standard error of a data items bound to the ItemsSource property of the calculator.

== Requirements

== Assembly Requirements

In order to use the link:{ApiPlatform}math.calculators{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.calculators.standarderrorcalculator.html[StandardErrorCalculator], the following assemblies must to be added to a {PlatformName} project.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Assembly|Description

|{ApiPlatform}Math.Calculators.{DllVersion}dll
|{ProductName} assembly containing mathematical calculators to compute correlation, mean, median, standard error, standard deviation and many more mathematical values.

|{ApiPlatform}Math.{DllVersion}dll
|{ProductName} assembly containing standard mathematical constants and all-purpose mathematical functions designed to act on a variety of mathematical objects.

|{ApiPlatform}{DllVersion}dll
|{ProductName} assembly containing shared functionality used by the Infragistics assemblies.

== Data Requirements

The link:{ApiPlatform}math.calculators{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.calculators.standarderrorcalculator.html[StandardErrorCalculator] uses ItemsSource property for data binding and ValueMemberPath property for data mapping. Any object that meets the following requirements can be bound to this property:

* The data model must implement link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[IEnumerable] interface (e.g. link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sh2ey19.aspx[List], link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132397.aspx[Collection], link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7977ey2c.aspx[Queue], link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.stack.aspx[Stack])
* The data model must contain items that have at least one numeric data column for calculating the standard error.

An example of object that meets above criteria is presented in the following code snippet:

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports System.Collections.Generic
'...
Public Class DataPointList
    Inherits List(Of DataPoint)
    Public Sub New(dataValues As IEnumerable(Of Double))
        For Each value As Double In dataValues
            Me.Add(New DataPoint() With { Key .Value = value })
        Next
    End Sub
End Class
Public Class DataPoint
    Public Property Value() As Double
        Get
            Return _value
        End Get
        Set
            _value = Value
        End Set
    End Property
    Private _value As Double
End Class
----

*In C#:*

----
using System.Collections.Generic;
//...
public class DataPointList : List<DataPoint>
{
    public DataPointList(IEnumerable<double> dataValues)
    {
        foreach (double value in dataValues)
        {
            this.Add(new DataPoint { Value = value});
        }
    }
}
public class DataPoint
{
    public double Value { get; set; }
}
----

== Example

This example demonstrates how to calculate standard error for a set of numbers using the StandardErrorCalculator. The StandardErrorCalculator is a non-visual element and it should be defined in resources section on application, page, control level, or in code-behind, the same way as you would define a data source or a variable. Also, refer to the link:datachart-series-error-bars.html[Series Error Bars] topic for examples on how to integrate the StandardErrorCalculator with the link:datachart-datachart.html[xamDataChart]™ control in order to calculate error bars for Series objects.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
The following example assumes that you added all required assemblies for the in your project.
====

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports Infragistics.Math.Calculators
'...
Dim data As New DataPointList(New List(Of Double)() From {     5.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 })
Dim calculator As New StandardErrorCalculator()
calculator.ValueMemberPath = "Value"
calculator.ItemsSource = data
Dim standardError As Double = calculator.Value
----

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Math.Calculators;
//...
DataPointList data = new DataPointList(new List<double> { 5.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 });
StandardErrorCalculator calculator = new StandardErrorCalculator();
calculator.ValueMemberPath = "Value";
calculator.ItemsSource = data;
double standardError = calculator.Value;
