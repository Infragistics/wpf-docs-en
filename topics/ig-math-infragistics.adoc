= Infragistics Math Library

The link:{ApiPlatform}math{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math_namespace.html[Infragistics Math Library]™ is a library of mathematical and statistical structures and functions that you can use with our {ProductName} product. It extends the operations in the link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.math.aspx[System.Math] class to several new mathematical objects:

* link:{ApiPlatform}math{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.complex.html[Complex Numbers]
* link:{ApiPlatform}math{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.constant.html[Mathematical constants]
* link:{ApiPlatform}math{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.vector.html[Vectors]

** link:{ApiPlatform}math{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.complexvector.html[Complex vectors]
** link:{ApiPlatform}math{ApiVersion}~infragistics.math.booleanvector.html[Boolean vectors]
