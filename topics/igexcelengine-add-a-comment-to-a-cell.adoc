= Adding a Comment to a Cell (Infragistics Excel Engine)

A comment allows you to display hints or notes for a cell when the end user's mouse hovers over a cell. The comments display as a tooltip-like callout that contains text. The Infragistics Excel Engine allows you to add comments to a cell by setting a link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheetcell.html[WorksheetCell] object’s link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheetcell~comment.html[Comment] property.

The following example code demonstrates how to add a comment to a cell. The example code assumes you have a reference to a Worksheet object named worksheet1.

*In Visual Basic:*
[source,vb]
----
Dim row As WorksheetRow = worksheet1.Rows(6)
row.Cells(0).Comment = New WorksheetCellComment() With { _
    .Text = New FormattedString("Comment for a cell")
}
----

*In C#:*
[source,csharp]
----
WorksheetRow row = worksheet1.Rows[6];
row.Cells[0].Comment = new WorksheetCellComment
{
    Text = new FormattedString("Comment for a cell")
