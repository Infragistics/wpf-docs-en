=== Description

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|For the following task|Use this property/method

|Inspect an unopened workbook for an open password.
|You can use these static methods on the link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook_members.html[Workbook] class: 

link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~isworkbookencrypted.html[IsWorkbookEncrypted(string)] 

link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~isworkbookencrypted.html[IsWorkbookEncrypted(Stream)] 

.Note 

[NOTE] 

==== 

When using the method with the `Stream` argument and the check is performed, this method will reset the stream position to the original value if `Stream.CanSeek` is true. 

====

|Load a workbook encrypted with an open password.
| link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~load.html[Load(string, WorkbookLoadOptions)] 

link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~load.html[Load(SecureString, WorkbookLoadOptions)] 

.Note 

[NOTE] 

==== 

If the password is supplied both as `string` and `SecureString` (in the link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbookloadoptions_members.html[WorkbookLoadOptions] argument), the one of type string will be used, because it requires no permission to obtain the string value. 

====

|Inspect an opened workbook for an open password.
| link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~hasopenpassword.html[HasOpenPassword] 

.Note 

[NOTE] 

==== 

This property returns true if the necessary open password was supplied and the file was opened successfully. This property also returns true if a subsequent save will save the workbook with an open password. 

====

|Set, change or clear the open password on an opened workbook.
| link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~setopenpassword.html[SetOpenPassword(string)] 

link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~setopenpassword.html[SetOpenPassword(SecureString)] 

.Note 

[NOTE] 

==== 

If you provide null or empty string, this will clear the current open password.

== Operate with Write Protected Workbook

=== Overview

The following table lists the properties and methods associated with dealing with write protected workbooks.

=== Description

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|For the following task|Use this property/method

|Inspect an opened workbook for write protection.
| link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~hasfilewriteprotectionpassword.html[HasFileWriteProtectionPassword] 

.Note 

[NOTE] 

==== 

This property indicates whether subsequently saved files will be write protected. You can only save write protected files when the correct password is validated using the `ValidateFileWriteProtectionPassword` or a new password is set using `SetFileWriteProtectionPassword`. 

====

|Check an opened workbook whether it has write protection and is the password validated.
| link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~isfilewriteprotected.html[IsFileWriteProtected] 

.Note 

[NOTE] 

==== 

This property returns true only if the opened workbook is write protected and the required password is still not provided. You should not allow automatic saves to the original location when this property returns true. If the correct password is provided this property will return false. 

====

|Validate the write protection password of an opened workbook.
| link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~validatefilewriteprotectionpassword.html[ValidateFileWriteProtectionPassword(string)] 

link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~validatefilewriteprotectionpassword.html[ValidateFileWriteProtectionPassword(SecureString)] 

.Note 

[NOTE] 

==== 

These methods return true if the workbook is write protected and the provided password was correct. The provided password will be cached and will be used for subsequent saves. 

====

|Set, change or clear the write protection password on an opened workbook.
| link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~setfilewriteprotectionpassword.html[SetFileWriteProtectionPassword(string)] 

link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~setfilewriteprotectionpassword.html[SetFileWriteProtectionPassword(SecureString)] 

.Note 

[NOTE] 

==== 

If you provide null or empty string, this will clear the current write protection password.
