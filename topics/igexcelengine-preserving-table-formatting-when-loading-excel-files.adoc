== Introduction

=== Overview

Each table has an associated style which provides default format settings for cells in many different areas of the table. This style is represented by the link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettablestyle~_ctor.html[WorksheetTableStyle] class and is exposed on a table through the `WorksheetTable` 's link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettable~style.html[Style] property. Preserving `WorksheetTableStyle` is supported, so when you are loading Excel files, your table formatting will be preserved.

|When you create a table (previously known as list) in a Microsoft Office Excel worksheet, you can manage and analyze the data in that table independently of data outside the table. For example, you can filter table columns, add a row for totals, apply table formatting, and publish a table to a server that is running Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.
