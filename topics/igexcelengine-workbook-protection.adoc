== Workbook Protection

=== Summary

The workbook protection feature allows you to protect (with or without password) the following user operations:

* Window protection: the ability to resize the MDI child window of the workbook for legacy versions of MS Excel which were displaying each workbook in a separate child window.
* Workbook structure: the ability to add, rename, delete, hide and reorder the worksheets.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The protection is not enforced via the Infragistics Excel Engine's object model. It is a responsibility of the UI visualizing this object model, to honor these protection settings and allow or restrict the user from performing the corresponding operations.
====

=== Configuration chart

The following table explains briefly the functional aspects of the workbook protection feature and maps them to the properties and methods that operate with them.

If the password supplied to the `Unprotect` methods does not match the password set on the workbook an exception will be thrown.

You can use the `Unprotect` overload method without password argument to remove protection even on password protected workbooks.
