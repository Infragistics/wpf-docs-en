== Worksheet Protection

=== Summary

The worksheet protection feature allows you to protect (with or without password) the following user operations:

* Inserting, deleting and formatting of columns
* Inserting, deleting and formatting of rows
* Inserting of hyperlinks
* Editing of objects (this setting allows or restricts editing of shapes, comments, charts or controls may be created or changed)
* Editing of scenarios (this setting allows or restricts existing scenarios)
* Filtering of data (this setting allows or restricts the use of auto filters)
* Formatting of cells (this setting allows or restricts the user from changing cells' formatting)
* Sorting of data
* Pivot tables (this setting allows or restricts the user from changing pivot tables)
* Cells editing (this setting allows or restricts the user from editing cells' value by providing cell ranges which can be edited when in protected mode)
* Cells selection (this setting allows or restricts the user selection to all cells, unlocked cells only or no selection)

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The protection is not enforced via the Infragistics Excel Engine's object model. It is a responsibility of the UI visualizing this object model, to honor these protection settings and allow or restrict the user from performing the corresponding operations.

|Operation|Details|Properties

|Set worksheet protection
|You can use the overloads of the `Protect` method to protect the worksheet with password (supplied using `string` or `SecureString`) or without password. The other arguments of this method are used to specify each protection setting described above.

|Remove worksheet protection
|You can use the overloads of the `Unprotect` method to remove worksheet protection set with or without password. 

If the password supplied to the `Unprotect` methods does not match the password set on the worksheet an exception will be thrown.

[NOTE] 

==== 

You can use the `Unprotect` overload method without password argument to remove protection even on password protected worksheets.
