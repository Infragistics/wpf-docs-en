== Introduction

=== Zooming summary

The worksheet allows you to control the magnification (zooming) level. The link:{ApiPlatform}controls.grids.xamspreadsheet.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.grids.xamspreadsheet.html[ _xamSpreadsheet_  ] control tries to scale the view content’s presentation (text, images, shapes …) consistently, however the cell borders are not scaled.
