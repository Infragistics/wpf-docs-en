  Description:
    Abstract: INDIANA_TR_24K_IGS_P is a 1:24,000-scale polygon
      shapefile with a projection of Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
      North American Datum (NAD) 1983 zone 16.
    Purpose: This shapefile was created as a framework layer defining the
      township or range lines of Indiana in polygon format.  The information
      is intended for geographic display or analysis at a scale of 1:24,000
      or smaller.
    Supplemental_Information: This shapefile was derived from a predecessor
      coverage named "IN_LANDSURVEY."  IN_LANDSURVEY is a digital
      representation of land survey features created by the Indiana
      Geological Survey as represented on the USGS 1:24,000 digital raster
      graphic (DRG) series. ESRI ArcEdit 8.1 and ESRI ArcView 3.2 were used
      to extract the following shapefiles from IN_LANDSURVEY:
      Indiana_CountyBdy_24k_IGS_l, Indiana_CountyBdy_24k_IGS_p,
      Indiana_LandSurvey_24k_IGS_l, Indiana_LandSurvey_24k_IGS_p,
      Indiana_StateBdy_24k_IGS_l, Indiana_StateBdy_24k_IGS_p,
      Indiana_TR_24k_IGS_l, and Indiana_TR_24k_IGS_p.

DATA_QUALITY_INFORMATION
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: All information contained in this shapefile
      Was extracted from the predecessor coverage IN_LANDSURVEY.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: A check was made for dangling nodes and none
    were detected.
  Completeness_Report: The original IN_LANDSURVEY line coverage was queried
    for layer_1 = STATE-BDY, T-R, T-R-CLOSE, OLSS-BDY, OLSS-BDY-CLOSE and
    layer_2 = T-R, LM-SHORE, OLSS-BDY, or OLSS-BDY-CLOSE. A check was made to
    verify that the township and range boundaries are identical to the
    township and range boundaries contained in the predecessor coverage
    IN_LANDSURVEY. 
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Accuracy is no better than that
        of the source material used to compile IN_LANDSURVEY.  The vector
        lines contained in IN_LANDSURVEY were corrected to DRG raster lines
        at an on-screen scale of 1:5,000 or better.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Vertical accuracy was not a factor
        in the digital production of the data set.

      Process_Description: IN_LANDSURVEY was opened in ESRI ArcEdit
        and queried for layer_1 = STATE-BDY or layer_1 = T-R or layer_1 =
        T-R-CLOSE or layer_1 = OLSS-BDY or layer_1 = OLSS-BDY-CLOSE or
        layer_2 = T-R or layer_2 = LM-SHORE or layer_2 = OLSS-BDY or
        layer_2 = OLSS-BDY-CLOSE. The new coverage was built with the no
        duplicate labels option. The attribute fields Type, Parcel_ID, and
        Source were deleted from the PAT file. The resulting coverage was
        opened in ESRI ArcView and saved as a polygon shapefile named
        INDIANA_TR_24K_IGS_P.
