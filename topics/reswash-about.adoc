= About Resource Washer

== ResourceWasher Configuration Overview

The  pick:[sl=" link:{ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.resourcewasher.html[ResourceWasher]"]  pick:[wpf=" link:{ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.themes.resourcewasher.html[ResourceWasher]"]™ component is a XAML cross platform feature; it has no visual representation as it is a ResourceDictionary. The purpose of the component is to provide you with an easy yet powerful way to wash one ResourceDictionary in a single or multiple colors during runtime.

Color washing is a process that changes the original color of a resource by specifying a new color ( pick:[sl=" link:{ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.resourcewasher~washcolor.html[WashColor]"]  pick:[wpf=" link:{ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.themes.resourcewasher~washcolor.html[WashColor]"]  property) and color transformation that is applied ( pick:[sl=" link:{ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.resourcewasher~washmode.html[WashMode]"]  pick:[wpf=" link:{ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.themes.resourcewasher~washmode.html[WashMode]"]  property) to a resource. The following table depicts a pivot grid before and after color washing. The “After” pivot grid is washed in Green with the default  pick:[sl=" link:{ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.washmode.html[WashMode]"]  pick:[wpf=" link:{ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.themes.washmode.html[WashMode]"]  (SoftLightBlend) :
