== Refreshing Cell Values

=== Feature summary

If the data presenter control is bound to a collection which does not raise property change notifications for its data items, e.g. if the collection does not implement the `IBindingList` interface or the data items do not implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface you may need to manually refresh the user interface after changes to a data item’s properties are made.

=== Methods summary

The following table explains briefly what refresh tasks can be performed by the controls.
