=== The specified control theme is not applied to child windows

When you interact with some of the Infragistics controls, additional popup windows are displayed (for example - the Field Chooser window in the _xamDataGrid_ control).

A theme applied to a control level doesn’t style these windows. You must set the specified theme on an application level to have all additional windows styled.

Workaround

[NOTE]
====
Apply the specified theme on an application level.
