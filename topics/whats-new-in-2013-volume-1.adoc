|Control|Feature|Description

|<<InfragisticsSyntaxParsingEngine,Infragistics Syntax Parsing Engine>>
|<<NewParsingEngine,New Parsing Engine>>
|The Infragistics Syntax Parsing Engine is a set of classes capable of reading custom programming language grammars defined in EBNF, and then proceed to analyze and process files in accordance with your custom defined grammar.

| _<<xamDataChart, xamDataChart >>_ 
|<<HighDensityScatterSeries,High Density Scatter Series>>
|The link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.highdensityscatterseries_members.html[HighDensityScatterSeries] series in the _xamDataChart_ control can be used to bind and show scatter data, ranging from hundreds to millions of data points, with an exceptionally quick loading time. The series displays the scatter data as tiny dots, as opposed to full size markers, due to the fact that there are so many data points. The area with the most data displays with the higher color density, like a cluster of data points.
|
|<<HoverInteractions,Chart Annotation Layers>>
|Chart Annotation Layers are implemented through hover interaction layers. These layers are actually series that are added to the series collection, and are dependent on the cursor position. Adding hover interaction layers to the _xamDataChart_ control disables the default behavior of the crosshairs, tooltips or both(depending on which type of layer added).

| _<<Ref351394689, xamDoughnutChart >>_ 
|<<_Ref351394696,Cross platform control>>
|A cross platform control representing a doughnut chart.

| _<<xamDataGrid, xamDataGrid >>_ 
|<<NewSortingBehavior,New Sorting Behavior>>
|The control offers new sorting capabilities via the UI or using code.
|
|<<NewGroupingBehavior,New Grouping Behavior>>
|The new grouping behavior allows users to group data into more readable and navigable arrangements.

| _<<xamGantt, xamGantt >>_ 
|<<_Ref346271621,Save Project to XML>>
|This control allows you to save the current project plan to an MS Project XML file.

| _<<xamGeographicMap, xamGeographicMap >>_ 
|<<DisplayingGeographicImageryfromArcGISOnlineServers,Displaying Geographic Imagery from ArcGIS Online Servers>>
|ArcGIS Online is an Esri product that allows you to create and share maps either publicly or privately. You can also access other maps created by Esri and other ArcGIS users. 

You can see a list of some available public maps at the following location, link:http://www.arcgis.com/home/group.html?owner=esri&title=ESRI%20Maps%20and%20Data[Esri Maps and Data Group].
|
|<<GeographicProportionalSymbolSeries,Geographic Proportional Symbol Series>>
|The link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.geographicproportionalsymbolseries_members.html[GeographicProportionalSymbolSeries] is a Scatter Series with data-driven symbol sizes. It implements link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.geographicsymbolseries_members.html[GeographicSymbolSeries] and has all the basic characteristics of the _xamDataChart_ control’s link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.bubbleseries_members.html[BubbleSeries].
|
|<<SimplifiedSupportforBingMapsImagery,Simplified Support for Bing Maps Imagery>>
|This simplified Bing Maps’ interface allows you to access Bing Maps with minimal set up. Previously, you had to configure a REST services to access Bing Maps and get the required URIs for the titles. With this release, this functionality is now built-in to the _xamGeographicMap_ control.
|
|<<UsingGeographicTileSeries,Using Geographic Tile Series>><<UsingGeographicTileSeries,>>
|The link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.geographictileseries_members.html[GeographicTileSeries] is a visual map element belonging to the _xamGeographicMap_ control that superimposes additional tile imagery over the base tile imagery defined in the _xamGeographicMap_ control’s link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xamgeographicmap~backgroundcontent.html[BackgroundContent] property. 

The link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.geographictileseries_members.html[GeographicTileSeries] is similar to the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.geographicpolylineseries_members.html[GeographicPolylineSeries] except that the polylines functions to clip the tile visuals rather than draw polylines.

| _<<Ref351395743, xamPivotGrid >>_ 
|<<_Ref351395827,Saving and Loading Grid Customizations>>
|This feature allows saving and restoring a particular state (hierarchies used for columns, rows, filters; expanded members’ states, etc.) of the _xamPivotGrid_ .

| _<<xamRibbon, xamRibbon >>_ 
|<<ApplicationMenu2010,Application Menu 2010>>
|The Application Menu 2010 features a File Tab before all other tabs and a backstage, which will cover the xamRibbon groups and extends to the size of the window containing the xamRibbon.

| _<<Ref346271560, xamSyntaxEditor >>_ 
|<<_Ref346271568,Clipboard Events>>
|This control exposes new events for supporting clipboard operations.
|
|<<_Ref346271581,Current Line Highlight>>
|This feature allows you to highlight the line containing the caret.
|
|<<_Ref346271588,Custom Adornments>>
|Adornments are visual elements displayed in the control’s text editing area providing users with visual cues.
|
|<<_Ref346271595,Ruler Margin>>
|The ruler margin visually indicates the location of the caret in the current line with a red dot.
|
|<<_Ref346271603,Whitespace Highlight>>
|This feature allows you to identify all the spaces and tabs occurring within the document.
|
|<<_Ref346271604,Transact-SQL>>
|Transact-SQL language support.

| _<<Ref351395987, xamTreemap >>_ 
|<<_Ref351395991,Tooltips>>
