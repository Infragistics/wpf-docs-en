=== Series Highlighting

You can now highlight an entire series or some individual items within the series.

The highlighting capabilities are series-specific. With single-shape series, such as Line series the entire line is highlighted, while with series consisting of multiple shapes, such as Column series, each individual shape (column) can be highlighted. In all supported series, individual markers can be highlighted.

The series highlighting feature is support for the following series types:

* Category Series
* RangeCategory Series
* Financial Series
* Financial Indicators

=== Labeling Callout Lines with Curves

This feature adds two types of curves to the straight lines used for the callout lines in the  _xamDoughnutChart_   and  _xamPieChart_  . You may choose whether to use a straight line or one of the curves, change the line style and control the spacing between the label and the end of the line.

== _xamGeographicMap_

[[_Ref367202921]]

=== High Density Scatter Series

The new geographic High-Density Scatter series allows you to bind and show scatter data ranging from hundreds to millions of data points requiring exceedingly little loading time.

Because of the sheer number of data points, the series displays the scatter data as tiny dots (as opposed to full-size markers) and the areas the most data-intensive areas – higher color density representing clusters of data points.
