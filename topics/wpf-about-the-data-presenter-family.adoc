= About the Data Presenter Family

Presenting and editing data has never been easier with the Infragistics Data Presenter Family (DPF) a new family of {ProductName} controls that empowers you to quickly create new and compelling user experiences while taking advantage of a shared foundation and API for data binding and automatic element generation. The DPF provides four essential functions for data presentation controls:

* automatically generated field layouts based on data source structure.
* coordinates with the view and generates cell layouts for each data record.
* ensures consistency between the data source and its presentation.
* facilitates data modifications to the underlying data source.

== Benefits

Like our link:http://www.infragistics.com/help/windows-forms/Win_PLF_Overview.html[Infragistics Presentation Layer Framework (PLF)™ in Windows Forms], the DPF provides compelling benefits for organizations using the {ProductName} product:

* Consistent programming model - When you use our data presenter controls, you can reuse much of your knowledge of APIs and concepts to enhance productivity no matter which control you're using.
* Inheritable architecture - The DPF is an open, pluggable architecture that allows new presenter controls and views to be created that take advantage of the DPF services while providing new and rich user experiences.
* Quality in design - Built from the ground up with WPF in mind and built on top decades of control design experience, the DPF provides all of the knobs and switches you have come to expect from Infragistics controls in a consistent and intuitive design.
* Reliability - While WPF is a new technology, UI control metaphors and patterns are not. You can use the DPF with the confidence that many years of UI design experience brings you.
