= Breaking Changes in 2012 Volume 2

== WPF Deprecated Controls

=== Deprecated controls

Starting with release of 2012 volume 2, the following controls will no longer be shipped as part of the {ProductName} product:

* xamChart™
* xamTileView™

== XAML Namespace mapping in WPF

=== Overview

The release of 2012 volume 2, introduces updates to some of the WPF assemblies to provide consistency in mapping XAML namespaces across these assemblies. Specifically, changes were made to the (static) `Resources` classes as defined by each of these assemblies. The newly created and shared namespaces house copies of the link:{ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.shared.dynamicresourcestring_members.html[DynamicResourceString] properties.

This is a listing of the obsolete URLs:

* http://infragistics.com/DataPresenter
* http://infragistics.com/DockManager
* http://infragistics.com/Editors
* http://infragistics.com/OutlookBar
* http://infragistics.com/Reporting
* http://infragistics.com/Themes
* http://infragistics.com/Windows

The new URL for mapping to WPF namespaces:

* `http://schemas.infragistics.com/xaml/wpf`

The following table maps the former class name to the new class name included in this release.

== New classes for `DynamicResourceString` properties.
