[[issue1]]
== RecordFilterAction Enumeration

=== RecordFilterAction enumeration description

The RecordFilterAction link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.recordfilteraction.html[RecordFilterAction] enumeration’s constant  *None*  is obsoleted. It is replaced with a new equivalent constant –  *ReduceOpacity* .

=== RecordFilterAction enumeration workaround

Change the  *None*  constant from the `RecordFilterAction` enumeration to the  *ReduceOpacity*  constant when using {ProductName} 13.1 or newer.

[[issue2]]
== Themes Restructuring

=== Theme.Colors.xaml description

This file is a ResourceDictionary. It contains color definitions that are used across all styles in a given Theme.

=== Styles.Shared.xaml description

This file is a ResourceDictionary. It contains styles and brushes that apply on common cross platform MS controls like Buttons, Checkboxes and Lists.

=== Styles.WPF.xaml description

This file is a ResourceDictionary. It contains styles and brushes for MS controls that are specific for WPF platform like Scrollers, TextBoxes and Comboboxes.

=== IG.$$*$$.xaml description

These files were cleaned up and restructured to use the Themes.Colors.xaml and the other common ResourceDictionaries like Styles.Shared.xaml, Styles.WPF.xaml and IG.DataVisualization.xaml

=== Themes restructuring workaround

Copy the new themes over the old ones and copy the needed relevant common files (Themes.Colors.xaml, Styles.Shared.xaml, Styles.WPF.xaml and IG.DataVisualization.xaml) next to the themes files.
