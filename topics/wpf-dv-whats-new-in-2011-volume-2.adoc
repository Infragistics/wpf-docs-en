== xamNetworkNode – Removing Nodes from Network

Remove nodes from a network from the network layout, and or from the data source.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Feature|Description

|Removing Node from NetworkNodeLayout
|Removing a node from the network layout is done by setting the visibility property of NetworkNodeNode to Collapsed.

|Removing Node from data source
|Removing the nodes from the data source requires that you remove them from the underlying collection. The control is notified of any changes made in the nodes’ collection, and gets updated reflective of the changes from the data model. For the change notification, your data must implement <a href="">INotifyPropertyChanged</a> interface.

|====

== xamNetworkNode – Show / Hide Nodes

The xamNetworkNode control now features a number of ways to show and hide nodes:

Show/Hide using the Expansion indicator

Show/Hide without Expansion indicator, using code behind

Enter key on the keyboard (when expansion indicators are visible)

In addition to the default modes, any node can hide itself by setting the node’s Visibility property to “Collapsed”.

The following image displays the xamNetworkNode control with expansion indicators enabled on the parent node. The parent nodes have connections to the child nodes that can be shown and hidden. The plus sign indicates that the child nodes are hidden

== xamNetworkNode – Displaying Visual States on Network Nodes

The xamNetworkNode control visual states are organized in groups, each consisting of several visual state properties where the control can be set to one of the states from any of the selected groups.

The following images illustrate the different visual states the xamNetworkNode control currently supports:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]

== xamPivotGrid™ - New Features

This section provides information about new features of the xamPivotGrid control.

== xamPivotGrid - Performance Improvement

In the xamPivotGrid™ control features a number of significant performance improvements. In the 2011 Volume 1 (previous) release, the control had performed with longer response time with 50,000 records. Now with the current release it can render 1,500,000 records in approximately 2 seconds.

In XMLA data source the data is organized in cubes and each dimension contains defined hierarchies. The current enhancement includes improving the hierarchy rendering which boosts the performance of the flat data source as well.

Please refer to the “Handling large data” sample in the Performance section of the samples browser, which demonstrates the improved performance capabilities.

== xamPivotGrid – Progress Indicator

The xamPivotGrid control’s DataSource now supports an IsBusy property which is used to determine if the data processing is still in progress (busy) or completed. This is identical to an existing property called “Processing” of xamPivotGrid control’s DataSource object. If the data processing is in progress the value is “true”. This allows the user to implement a progress indicator; if desired; to display on the page during the time of processing or loading the data.

Preview of the progress indicator while the xamPivotGrid is busy loading data.

image::images/Whats_New_In_2011_Volume_2_xamPivotGrid_01.png[]

== xamPivotGrid – Data Slicer

The xamPivotDataSlicer™ control features an easier way of filtering the data in addition to the existing pivot grid filtering. With this enhanced filtering capability you can now filter the hierarchies selected in columns, rows and filter areas in conjunction with the measures of the pivot grid simply by using the items listed in the data slicer. One or more items can be select by pressing down the Ctrl key on the keyboard and Left mouse button click.

In the following image you can see the selected items on the data slicer filtering the information shown in the data hierarchy.

image::images/Whats_New_In_2011_Volume_2_xamPivotGrid_02.png[]

== xamPivotGrid – Integration with xamDataChart (CTP)

The {ApiPlatform}Controls.Charts.OlapAxis.{DllVersion} assembly exposes a new axis type called OlapAxis which is used by the xamDataChart control to plot data. The OlapAxis is the key element of the integration process in a sense that it is bound to the same data source as the pivot grid using the DataSource property. The supported data source types are XMLADataSource and FlatDataSource of the pivot grid. For more details and code examples refer to the link:xampivotgrid-integration-with-chart.html[Integration with Data Chart] topic.

Preview of xamPivotGrid integration with xamDataChart.

image::images/Whats_New_In_2011_Volume_2_xamPivotGrid_03.png[]

== xamSparkline™- New Control (CTP)

The xamSparkline is a full functional chart that can fit in one grid cell. Currently this is a Community Technology Preview control, and it supports four chart types: Line, Area, Column, and WinLoss. The chart renders with one dimensional data of type Numeric or DateTime. It has a capability to display the markers such as high/Low, first/last, negative and markers for all data points.

Here are the different chart types showing the High and Low markers:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]

|WinLoss 

Displays positive and negative values as well as markers (high / low)
|image::images/Whats_New_In_2011_Volume_2_xamSparkline_05.png[] 

|====

== xamTimeline™ - Auto Adjust Labels Based on Zooming

The timeline labels now have the capability to automatically adjust the tick marks based on zooming in on the selected time segment of the data. For example:

* When Timeline displays Year unit type, the tick marks will display the Months after zooming.
* When Timeline displays Month unit type, the tick marks will display the Days after zooming.
* When Timeline displays Day unit type, the tick marks will display the Hours after zooming.

Before zooming: the control displays the days of the month:

image::images/Whats_New_In_2011_Volume_2_xamTimeline_01.png[]

After zooming: The control Auto-Adjusts the labels and displays the hours:

image::images/Whats_New_In_2011_Volume_2_xamTimeline_02.png[]

Refer to the link:xamtimeline-auto-adjust-labels.html[Auto Adjust Labels] topic for more information on this feature.

== Resource Washer

With Resource Washing, you can set the color (the WashColor) on groups of resources (WashGroups) in an existing ResourceDictionary to update the color of the controls in your application.
