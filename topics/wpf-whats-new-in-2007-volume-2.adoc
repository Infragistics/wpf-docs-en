[[xamChart]]

== xamChart

The xamChart™ control is a new visual control that presents data using graphics. The xamChart control displays values using columns, pie wedges, cylinders and more.

== Chart Types

The xamChart control supports 25 different chart types, which will allow you to select the perfect look to accent the data in your application.

== Composite Charts

The xamChart control was built with composite chart creation in mind. Creating composite charts has never been so easy. Simply add a couple Series to xamChart and bind them to data. Make each Series render a different chart type to create complex composite charts.

[[xamComboEditor]]

== xamComboEditor

The xamComboEditor™ control is an editor control that provides a drop-down list from which your end user can select a single item.

In the previous release, xamDataGrid™ did not include a drop-down editor that could be used for editing data. With the release of xamComboEditor, you can edit the value of a link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.cell.html[Cell] using a drop-down list populated with items. Using a drop-down list inside of xamDataGrid can help decrease the amount of typographic errors during data entry.

[[xamRibbon]]

== xamRibbon

The xamRibbon™ control is a menu control that replicates the Microsoft® Office® 2007 Ribbon functionality in a Microsoft® Windows® Presentation Foundation application. Instead of using the plain, default, drop-down menu of decades past, you can use xamRibbon to give your application a stylish look and feel. Not only can you improve your application's look and feel, you can also improve usability by using xamRibbon's many features.

== Application Menu

The application menu is the main menu of the application. The application menu is divided into three separate areas:

* The left area displays buttons intended for file operations.
* The right area displays buttons similarly to the left area. Another use for the right area might be a most recently used list.
* The bottom area displays buttons such as application options or an exit button.

== Quick Access Toolbar

The Quick Access Toolbar (QAT) is a small, user-configurable toolbar that is always visible either above (default) or below the Ribbon. The QAT's versatility is shown when adding any Ribbon tool to it; in fact, you can add an entire RibbonGroup to the QAT with ease.

== Tabs and Tab Groups

If you have ever used a Tab in an application, xamRibbon's object model will quickly become familiar to you. The xamRibbon control includes a collection of tabs, each with a collection of groups, each group with a collection of tools. This structure allows you to organize tools into functionally-related application tasks that your end users can easily discover.
