[[schedule]]

== xamSchedule Control

The {ProductName} 2010 volume 3 includes a new suite of scheduling components comprised of three new controls designed to address any scheduling requirements your applications may have. These new controls – xamDayView, xamScheduleView and xamMonthView – are coupled with an easy-to-use xamScheduleDataManager responsible for providing the resources, calendars, activities and other configuration settings.

As part of the Infragistics unified XAML strategy, these controls are provided as both Silverlight and WPF controls with identical APIs and object models, enabling you to create scheduling applications with a single set of code that can be built to target either platform.

In addition, the xamSchedule suite includes robust data connector architecture for accessing any type of backend data source containing scheduling information. For 10.3 we are shipping two connectors: a ListScheduleDataConnector for hooking up to any local list of scheduling data, and a WcfListScheduleDataConnector for use by applications that need to access data on a server. The WcfListScheduleDataConnector consists of a client-side connector and a server-side service that communicate via Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to provide data to the xamSchedule controls.
