[[DragDropFramework]]

== Infragistics Drag And Drop Framework

The {ProductName} 2011 Volume 1 release contains a new Drag and Drop Framework. This framework provides the necessary pieces to make it as simple as possible to add drag and drop functionality to your application. This allows for real-time moving of elements and more user-friendly interactions.

Utilizing the Drag and Drop Framework requires that you set a source and a target element. The source element can be dragged and dropped onto the target element. In some cases, it is as simple as that to implement drag and drop in your application.
