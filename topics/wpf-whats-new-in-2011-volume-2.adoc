[[xamCalculationManagerxamDataGrid]]
==== Using xamCalculationManager with xamDataGrid

You can use the xamCalculationManager™ control in combination with the xamDataGrid™ control to perform calculations using field values as sources and targets for the computations.

image::images/xamCalculationManager_Using_with_xamDataGrid.png[]

*Related topics:*

* link:using-xamcalculationmanager-with-xamdatagrid.html[Using xamCalculationManager with xamDataGrid]

[[xamGrid]]
==== xamGrid™

The xamGrid™ is a cross-platform control, that pushes the envelope of performance with data and UI virtualization. Your grid could have thousands of records and your end users will not encounter any performance issues.

The following is a list of some of the features of the xamGrid control:

*High Performance* – Data and UI virtualization makes xamGrid extremely lightweight and fast when handling large amounts of data.

*Hierarchical Data* - You can display complex hierarchical data with master/detail data relationships and different column layouts at each level.

*Editable* - The xamGrid control allows inline editing, add new row, and events for the create, read, update and delete operations.

*Flexible Columns* – Your end users can fix columns, move columns, resize columns and sort columns.

*Paging* - This feature breaks data into pages, reducing load time and increasing performance.

*Filtering* - This feature allows your end users to view a subset of data in a more manageable way which helps them to locate their required data.

*Templates* – You can style your xamGrid so that you can maintain a consistent look and feel throughout your entire application.

[[xamInputs]]
==== xamInputs

The controls in the xamInputs group are meant to guide the users during data entry and give you an opportunity to check if the entered data meets some predefined criteria. The controls are cross-platform by design therefore you can use them in Silverlight or WPF interchangeably. The input controls can be used as standalone text boxes or in combination with other controls, for example as cells in a xamGrid control.*

* link:xaminputs-masks.html[Masks]

[[xamMaskedInput]]
==== xamMaskedInput

Starting with {ProductName} 2011 Volume 2 brings the new control, xamMaskedInput™. The xamMaskedInput control allows you to specify input masks to restrict or help guide user input. You can define literal characters, input flags, or prompt characters in the input mask. Literal characters separate or distinguish parts of the input (such as slashes in date fields), input flags restrict the type of characters your end user can input, and prompt characters indicate placeholders where data can be entered.

You can specify required or optional characters using input flags and check to see if all required data are entered. Further, xamMaskedInput allows you to retrieve just the raw input entered by your end user as well as the input including literal and prompt characters.

The xamMaskedInput control also lets you specify what should be the behavior of the control when invalid value is entered e.g. display error message, revert to the original value etc.

[[xamCurrencyInput]]
==== xamCurrencyInput

Starting with {ProductName} 2011 Volume 2, introduces the new xamCurrencyInput™ control. The xamCurrencyInput control is a simple text box control that uses a mask to display numeric values as a type of currency. Using this mask, you can prepend a value with a given culture's currency symbol. You can also ensure that the fraction portion of the value remains intact up to the hundredths place, even if there is no remainder.

[[xamDateTimeInput]]
==== xamDateTimedInput

With the new release of the {ProductName} 2011 Volume 2 comes the xamDateTimeInput™ control. The xamDateTimeInput control is a simple text box control that uses a mask to assist users in entering dates and/or time values in the correct format. Using this mask, you can restrict the user's input to valid date and time formats that you decide beforehand. The control also provides a calendar drop down from which to choose a date.

[[xamCalculationManager]]
==== xamCalculationManager

The xamCalculationManager control allows you to create complex formulas which will be dynamically calculated to produce results. The sources and targets for these formulas can be any public property of any object for item calculations. Formulas using lists of items can also be created to perform aggregate functions for example Sum and Average.

==== xamTileManager™

The xamTileManager™ is a new cross-platform control, which displays content using rectangular tiles, which are arranged sequentially creating multiple rows of tiles. Your end users can maximize one or more tiles, which automatically minimizes the remaining tiles. However, the minimized tiles will remain in view along an edge of the control, so your end users can quickly maximize and shift their attention to new content.

The xamComboEditor™ is a new cross-platform control, which allows you to bind a list of items to a control. It is a flat data bound control and contains two main entries – a drop-down container for the items and a value display for the user input.

The main features of the xamComboEditor are:

* Virtualized: the xamComboEditor can display a large number of items very quickly.
* You can write directly into the value input field and add the input as xamComboEditor control item.
* You can customize the behavior of the xamComboEditor according to your application logic - it can be used as a read-only combo box or as a Google style Type Ahead control.
* It has two primary modes: Selectable and Editable mode.

[[xamMultiCCE]]
==== xamMultiColumnComboEditor™

The xamMultiColumnComboEditor acts just like a grid; it can automatically generate columns for every property on the data object that is contained in the IEnumerable that is set on the control’s ItemsSource property. The control’s AutoGenerateColumns property (which defaults to true) controls this behavior.
