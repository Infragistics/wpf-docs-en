=== Overview

The  _xamBusyIndicator_   control provides Progress Bar animation that has two modes – determinate and indeterminate.

Use the link:{RootAssembly}{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.interactions.xambusyindicator~animation.html[Animation] property to set the animation to pre-built type `ProgressBar`.

Use the link:{RootAssembly}{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.interactions.xambusyindicator~isindeterminate.html[IsIndeterminate] property and set it to `False` in order to switch the animation to determinate mode.

Use the link:{RootAssembly}{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.interactions.xambusyindicator~progressvalue.html[ProgressValue] property to set progress value.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The `ProgressValue` property takes values in the range from 0 to 1.
