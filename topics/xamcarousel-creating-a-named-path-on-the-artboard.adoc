= Creating a Named Path on the Artboard

The xamCarouselPanel™, xamCarouselListBox™, xamDataCarousel™, and xamDataPresenter™ Carousel View controls use a path to display items. These controls use a built in path if you don't specify one. However, you can create your own custom path for these controls. You can use Microsoft® Expression® Blend to draw a path and then import it into your Visual Studio project.

Follow these steps to create a named path in Expression Blend's Artboard.

[start=1]
. Create a New Project.
[start=2]
. From the toolbox area on the left, select the Pen tool.

[start=3]
. Draw a path on the Artboard. Simply click multiple areas on the Artboard and Blend will connect the points, creating the path.
