= About xamColorPicker

The xamColorPicker™ control is an editor that allows your end users to select a color from a pre-defined palette of colors. The control exposes the palette inside a drop-down container and as well as containing a pre-defined palette, it also allows you to define your own custom set of palettes. The value returned by the xamColorPicker control is the selected color.

*Key Features*
