----
var colorPicker = new XamColorPicker {SelectedColor = Colors.Blue, Height = 30, Width = 150};

== Using the SelectedColorChanged Event

=== Overview

The `SelectedColorChanged` event is fired when the selected color within the  _xamColorPicker_   is changed.

It is fired when a user clicks on a specific color in some of the  _xamColorPicker_   Palettes.

This event receives an argument of type link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xamcolorpicker{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.selectedcolorchangedeventargs_members.html[SelectedColorChangedEventArgs] that provides information about the new and previous selected color.

[[_Ref393992051]]
[[_Ref394389905]]
== Previewing the Selected Color

Use the  _xamColorPicker_   `SelectedColorPreview` property to identify the color that is currently being hovered.

This property is updated every time a user hovers over a color from the Current Color Palette, the Derived Color Palette, the Recent Color Palette or the palette in the Advanced editor.

In case the user isn’t hovering over colors, the `SelectedColorPreview` value is the same as the `SelectedColor` value.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired behavior to the property settings that manage it.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Use this property:|And set it to:

|Preview the selected color on mouse hover
| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xamcolorpicker{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.xamcolorpicker~selectedcolorpreview.html[SelectedColorPreview]
|`Color?`
