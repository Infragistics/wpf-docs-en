= About xamCurrencyEditor

The xamCurrencyEditor™ control is a simple text box control that uses a mask to display values as a type of currency. Using this mask, you can prepend a value with a culture's currency symbol. You can also ensure that the fraction portion of the value remains intact up to the hundredths place, even if there is no remainder. Use the xamCurrencyEditor control either as a stand-alone editor or in a Field of the xamDataGrid™ control. As a Field in xamDataGrid, xamCurrencyEditor assists end users in data input while still keeping the proper format of a specific grid column.
