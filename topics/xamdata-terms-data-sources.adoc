= Data Sources

Your data source can be any object implementing the link:http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[IEnumerable] interface (other than a String) that can be set as the DataSource. The control infrastructure supports both hierarchical and heterogeneous data (multiple data types within a single list), and free-form structures such as trees and XML. You can either data bind by setting the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.datapresenterbase~datasource.html[DataSource] property on the control, or through populating the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.datapresenterbase~dataitems.html[DataItems] collection property directly.

For more information on how to supply your data to the control, see link:xamdata-supplying-data.html[Supplying Data].
