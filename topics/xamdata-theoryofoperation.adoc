= Theory of Operation

link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.datapresenterbase.html[DataPresenterBase] is an abstract base class for the xamDataCarousel™, xamDataGrid™, xamDataCards™, and xamDataPresenter™ controls. While the first two controls present data in either a carousel or conventional grid view, the xamDataPresenter control exposes a pluggable view architecture for extending its presentation beyond the two views supplied in the product. The xamDataPresenter control also supports switching between views at run time.

However, all four controls (xamDataCarousel, xamDataGrid, xamDataCards, and xamDataPresenter) share a common theory of operation. The DataPresenterBase class provides the following four essential functions:

* Binding to data, analyzing its structure, and generating link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayout.html[FieldLayouts] that correspond to that structure.
* Coordinating with the view to generate cell layouts to represent each link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.datarecord.html[DataRecord].
* Listening for changes that originate from the data source and synchronizing the control so that it matches.
* Facilitating user updates to the data through the UI (e.g., adding new records, deleting existing records, and editing cell values).
