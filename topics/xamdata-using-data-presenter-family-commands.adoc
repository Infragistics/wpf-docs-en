= Using Data Presenter Family Commands

The xamDataCarousel™, xamDataGrid™, and xamDataPresenter™ controls provide their own set of command bindings which you can use to perform certain actions on the controls. All of these controls available bindings reside in the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.datapresentercommands_members.html[DataPresenterCommands] class.

A few of the available commands include:

* CellAbove
* CellRight
* DeleteSelectedDataRecords
* ExpandRecord
* RecordAbove
* StartEditMode
* and many more...

To see these commands in action, view the sample in xamFeatureBrowser under the xamDataGrid category called "xamDataGrid Commands."
