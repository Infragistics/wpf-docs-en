= About xamDataCards

The xamDataCards™ control displays flat data using "cards" similar to the Contacts folder in Microsoft® Outlook 2007. Since the xamDataCards control derives from the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.datapresenterbase.html[DataPresenterBase] class, it inherits the core functionality found in the DataPresenter controls. However, the xamDataCards control does not support the following features:

* Hierarchical Data
* Fixed Records
* Grouping
* Summaries
* Fixed Fields

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The xamDataCards control is optimized for displaying a moderate number of cards (for example 15-25) each with multiple fields that display labels and values along with a number of options for animation, card contents scrolling and card orientation. Scenarios which involve showing of hundreds of cards may experience performance issues.
