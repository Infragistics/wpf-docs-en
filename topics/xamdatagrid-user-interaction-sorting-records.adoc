=== Sort by field inside Group-by area

Users can sort `GroupByRecord`s by clicking on the Label Presenter in the Group-by area. By default, dragging a field label presenter into the group-by area causes the records to sort by this field in ascending order.

When clicking on a Label Presenter already contained within the group-by area, users can change the sort order using the UI as show in the following screenshot.

=== Sort by field outside group-by area

Users can sort fields contained in each `GroupByRecord` simply by clicking on the desired field’s Label Presenter; however, you will not see this unless you expand the `GroupByRecord`.

=== Sort by same field inside and outside group-by area

The sorting order selected in the `GroupByRecord` Label Presenter determines whether records sort in ascending or descending order when users group by a field.

It is possible for users to sort by the same field within each group using a different sort order, by clicking on the field within their respective group.

=== Sort by multiple fields outside group-by area

Users can sort by multiple fields contained in each `GroupByRecord` by pressing and holding the CTRL key and clicking on each of the desired fields’ Label Presenter. Sort order criteria are determined by the order in which fields are selected with the first selection determining the first sort criteria, the second selection the second sort criteria and so on.

The preceding screenshot illustrates record order after initially grouping on "OrderDate", then selecting "Product Name" and "OrderDate" in that order and applying sort by multiple fields.
