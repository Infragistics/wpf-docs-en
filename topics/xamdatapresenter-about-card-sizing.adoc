= About Card Sizing

The xamDataCards™ control offers several different ways to set the height and width of its cards.

* You can specify the cards' width or height by setting the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.cardviewsettings.html[CardViewSettings] object's link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.cardviewsettings~cardwidth.html[CardWidth] or link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.cardviewsettings~cardheight.html[CardHeight] properties, respectively.
* You can allow your end users to resize the cards' width or height at run time by setting the CardViewSettings object's link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.cardviewsettings~allowcardwidthresizing.html[AllowCardWidthResizing] or link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.cardviewsettings~allowcardheightresizing.html[AllowCardHeightResizing] properties to True. The xamDataCards control synchronizes resizing operations across all cards.
* You can automatically stretch the cards to take up all the available space within the xamDataCards control by setting the CardViewSettings object's link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.cardviewsettings~autofitcards.html[AutoFitCards] property to an link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.autofitcards.html[AutoFitCards] enum value. The xamDataCards control can stretch cards horizontally, vertically or both.

The following example code demonstrates how to make the cards automatically take up all the available space.

<igDP:XamDataCards Name="xamDataCards1">
    <igDP:XamDataCards.ViewSettings>
        <igDP:CardViewSettings AutoFitCards="HorizontallyAndVertically" />
    </igDP:XamDataCards.ViewSettings>
</igDP:XamDataCards>
----

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports Infragistics.Windows.DataPresenter
...
Me.xamDataCards1.ViewSettings.AutoFitCards = AutoFitCards.HorizontallyAndVertically
...
----

*In C#:*

----
using Infragistics.Windows.DataPresenter;
...
this.xamDataCards1.ViewSettings.AutoFitCards = AutoFitCards.HorizontallyAndVertically;
...
