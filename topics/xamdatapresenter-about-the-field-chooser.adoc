= About the Field Chooser

The link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldchooser.html[FieldChooser] control allows your end users to change the visibility of fields in the DataPresenter controls at run time. The FieldChooser control displays a list of field headers along with check boxes. Your end users can toggle a check box next to a field header or they can drag field headers in/out of the FieldChooser control to toggle the field's visibility. In addition, if you are binding your DataPresenter control to a hierarchical data source, the FieldChooser control will allow your end users to select a field layout from a drop-down list.

The DataPresenter controls offer three different options to display the field chooser.

* Display a FieldChooser control external to the DataPresenter control.
* Display a field chooser button in the header prefix area that your end users can click to display the field chooser.
* Invoke/execute the ShowFieldChooser method/command.
