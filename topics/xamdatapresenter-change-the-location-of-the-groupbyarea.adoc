= Change the Location of the GroupByArea

The xamDataPresenter™ control displays the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.groupbyarea.html[GroupByArea] above the data by default. You can change the location of the GroupByArea by setting the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.datapresenterbase~groupbyarealocation.html[GroupByAreaLocation] property.

The following procedure assumes you have a data bound xamDataPresenter, and you want to relocate the GroupByArea. For more information, see link:xamdatapresenter-getting-started-with-xamdatapresenter.html[Adding xamDataPresenter to Your Application].

[start=1]
. The following XAML creates an instance of XamDataPresenter and names it. The XAML then sets the GroupByAreaLocation property to BelowDataArea.

*In XAML:*

----
<igDP:XamDataPresenter x:Name="XamDataPresenter1" 
  ...
  GroupByAreaLocation="BelowDataArea"/>
----

[start=2]
. Build and run the project. You'll notice the group-by area bar at the bottom, and if you expand it you will see something similar to the image below.
