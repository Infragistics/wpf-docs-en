= Disable GroupBy

The xamDataPresenter™ control displays a link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.groupbyarea.html[GroupByArea] above the data area. You can prevent the GroupByArea from displaying by setting the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.datapresenterbase~groupbyarealocation.html[GroupByAreaLocation] property.

The following procedure assumes you have a data bound xamDataPresenter, and you want to hide the GroupByArea, so that end users can't group fields. For more information, see link:xamdatapresenter-getting-started-with-xamdatapresenter.html[Adding xamDataPresenter to Your Application].

[start=1]
. The following XAML creates an instance of XamDataPresenter and names it. The XAML then sets the GroupByAreaLocation property to None.

*In XAML:*

----
<igDP:XamDataPresenter x:Name="XamDataPresenter1" 
  ...
  GroupByAreaLocation="None"/>
----

[start=2]
. Build and run the project. You should see xamDataPresenter without a group-by area similar to the image below.
