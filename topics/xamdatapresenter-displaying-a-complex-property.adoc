= Displaying a Complex Property

== Before You Begin

When you data bind xamDataPresenter™, the xamDataPresenter control will automatically create link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.field.html[Fields] for each public property in your business object. If the property is a complex property, the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.cell.html[Cell] will display the result of the ToString method of that property.

For example, let's assume that you have a Name class that exposes two public properties, a FirstName property and a LastName property that both return strings. You also have a Customer class that exposes two public properties, a FullName property that returns a Name object, and an ID property that returns an integer. If you bind xamDataPresenter to a collection of Customers, xamDataPresenter will not display the FirstName and LastName properties of the FullName property. Instead, you will see the result of the ToString method of the Name class, which normally returns the fully qualified name of the Type.

== What You Will Accomplish

Most of the time, instead of displaying the result of the ToString method of a complex property, you may want to display separate fields for its sub-properties. To accomplish this, you will add an `UnboundField` object for each sub-property you want to display. You will then set the `UnboundField.BindingPath` property and `UnboundField.BindingMode` property of the UnboundField to bind the Cell values in the unbound field to a sub-property.

== Follow these Steps

[start=1]
. Download and add the link:resources-customer-data.html[CustomerData] class to your project.

The CustomerData class is available for you in C# and VB.NET to download and use in your project while working through this topic. The implementation details of the CustomerData class will not be covered in this topic as it is beyond the scope of this topic.

[start=2]
. Attach an event handler for the Window's Loaded event.
+
*In XAML:*
+
[source,xaml]
----
<Window ... Loaded="Window_Loaded">
----

[start=3]
. Add a xamDataPresenter control to your Window.
+
--
.. Name the xamDataPresenter control so you can reference it in the code-behind.
.. Attach an event handler for the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.datapresenterbase~fieldlayoutinitialized_ev.html[FieldLayoutInitialized] event.
--
+
*In XAML:*
+
[source,xaml]
----
...
<igDP:XamDataPresenter 
    Name="xamDataPresenter1" 
    FieldLayoutInitialized="xamDataPresenter1_FieldLayoutInitialized">
</igDP:XamDataPresenter>
...
----

[start=4]
. Before you start writing any code, you should place using/Imports directives in your code-behind so you don't need to type out a member's fully qualified name.
+
*In Visual Basic:*
+
[source,vb]
----
Imports Infragistics.Windows.DataPresenter
----
+
*In C#:*
+
[source,csharp]
----
using Infragistics.Windows.DataPresenter;
using System.Windows.Data;
----

[start=5]
. In the code-behind, find the event handler for the Window's Loaded event.
+
*In Visual Basic:*
+
[source,vb]
----
...
Private Sub Window_Loaded(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs)
    'TODO: Turn off automatic generation of Fields for xamDataPresenter 
    'TODO: Bind xamDataPresenter to data 
End Sub
...
----
+
*In C#:*
+
[source,csharp]
----
...
private void Window_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    //TODO: Turn off automatic generation of Fields for xamDataPresenter
    //TODO: Bind xamDataPresenter to data
}
...
----

[start=6]
. Turn off automatic generation of Fields for xamDataPresenter. You must do this before setting the DataSource property of the control.
+
*In Visual Basic:*
+
[source,vb]
----
...
Me.xamDataPresenter1.FieldLayoutSettings.AutoGenerateFields = False
...
----
+
*In C#:*
+
[source,csharp]
----
...
this.xamDataPresenter1.FieldLayoutSettings.AutoGenerateFields = false;
...
----

[start=7]
. Set the xamDataPresenter control's DataSource property to the collection of Customers returned from the GetCustomers method in the CustomerData class.
+
*In Visual Basic:*
+
[source,vb]
----
...
Me.xamDataPresenter1.DataSource = CustomerData.GetCustomers()
...
----
+
*In C#:*
+
[source,csharp]
----
...
this.xamDataPresenter1.DataSource = IGDocumentation.CustomerData.GetCustomers();
...
----

[start=8]
. Find the event handler for the xamDataPresenter1 control's FieldLayoutInitialized event.
+
*In Visual Basic:*
+
[source,vb]
----
...
Private Sub xamDataPresenter1_FieldLayoutInitialized(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As Infragistics.Windows.DataPresenter.Events.FieldLayoutInitializedEventArgs)
    'TODO: Add Field objects and UnboundField objects to the FieldLayout
End Sub
...
----
+
*In C#:*
+
[source,csharp]
----
...
private void xamDataPresenter1_FieldLayoutInitialized(object sender, Infragistics.Windows.DataPresenter.Events.FieldLayoutInitializedEventArgs e)
{
    //TODO: Add Field objects and UnboundField objects to the FieldLayout
}
...
----

[start=9]
. Add a Field object to the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldcollection.html[Fields collection].
+
--
.. Set the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fielditem~name.html[Name] property to "ID".
+
The Name property of a Field object must match the name of a property in the business object.
.. Set the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fielditem~label.html[Label] property to "Customer ID#".
--
+
*In Visual Basic:*
+
[source,vb]
----
...
Dim idField as New Field()
idField.Name = "ID"
idField.Label = "Customer ID#"
e.FieldLayout.Fields.Add(idField)
...
----
+
*In C#:*
+
[source,csharp]
----
...
Field idField = new Field();
idField.Name = "ID";
idField.Label = "Customer ID#";
e.FieldLayout.Fields.Add(idField);
...
----

[start=10]
. Add an UnboundField to the Fields collection.
+
--
.. Set the Name property to "FirstName".
+
Unlike a regular Field object, the Name property of an UnboundField object does not have to match the name of a property in the business object. You can use the value of the Name property as a key to retrieve a reference to the UnboundField object in the Fields collection using procedural code.
.. Set the Label property to "First Name".
.. Set the BindingPath property to "FullName.FirstName".
+
You need to set the BindingPath property to a property path on the business object.
.. Set the BindingMode property to "TwoWay".
+
The default value of the BindingMode property is OneWay. If you do not set the BindingMode property to TwoWay, your data model will not reflect any of the changes made to the values in the unbound fields.
--
+
*In Visual Basic:*
+
[source,vb]
----
...
Dim firstNameField as New UnboundField()
firstNameField.Name = "FirstName"
firstNameField.Label = "First Name"
firstNameField.BindingMode = BindingMode.TwoWay

Dim path As New PropertyPath("FullName.FirstName")
firstNameField.BindingPath = path

e.FieldLayout.Fields.Add(firstNameField)
...
----
+
*In C#:*
+
[source,csharp]
----
...
UnboundField firstNameField = new UnboundField();
firstNameField.Name = "FirstName";
firstNameField.Label = "First Name";
firstNameField.BindingMode = BindingMode.TwoWay;

PropertyPath path = new PropertyPath("FullName.FirstName");
firstNameField.BindingPath = path;

e.FieldLayout.Fields.Add(firstNameField);
...
----

[start=11]
. Add another UnboundField to the Fields collection.
+
--
.. Set the Name property to "LastName".
.. Set the Label property to "Last Name".
.. Set the BindingPath property to "FullName.LastName".
.. Set the BindingMode property to "TwoWay".
--
+
*In Visual Basic:*
+
[source,vb]
----
...
Dim lastNameField as New UnboundField()
lastNameField.Name = "LastName"
lastNameField.Label = "Last Name" 
path = New PropertyPath("FullName.LastName")
lastNameField.BindingPath = path
lastNameField.BindingMode = BindingMode.TwoWay
e.FieldLayout.Fields.Add(lastNameField)
...
----
+
*In C#:*
+
[source,csharp]
----
...
UnboundField lastNameField = new UnboundField();
lastNameField.Name = "LastName";
lastNameField.Label = "Last Name";
path = new PropertyPath("FullName.LastName");
lastNameField.BindingPath = path;
lastNameField.BindingMode = BindingMode.TwoWay;
e.FieldLayout.Fields.Add(lastNameField);
...
----

[start=12]
. Run the project and you should see two unbound fields that display the first name and last name of the customer.
