= Enable Fixed Records

You can enable fixed records for the xamDataPresenter™ control or the xamDataGrid™ control by setting a link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayoutsettings.html[FieldLayoutSettings] object's link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayoutsettings~allowrecordfixing.html[AllowRecordFixing] property to one of the following link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.allowrecordfixing.html[AllowRecordFixing] enum values:

* Top - Your end users can click a record's pin icon to fix it to the top of the record list. Clicking on a fixed record's pin icon will unfix the record.
* Bottom - Your end users can click a record's pin icon to fix it to the bottom of the record list. Clicking on a fixed record's pin icon will unfix the record.
* TopOrBottom - Your end users can click a record's pin icon to display a pop-up menu that allows them to choose the record's fixed location. Clicking on a fixed record's pin icon will display a pop-up menu that allows them to either unfix the record or fix it to the opposite edge.
