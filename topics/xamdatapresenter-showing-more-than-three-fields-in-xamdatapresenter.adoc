= Showing More Than Three Fields in xamDataPresenter

By default, the xamDataPresenter's™ Carousel View will show only the first three field values when it is displayed.

You can change this setting so that all the fields are shown, by setting the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayoutsettings~autoarrangemaxrows.html[AutoArrangeMaxRows] property to 0. The following example code shows how to set this property.

*In XAML:*

----
<igDP:XamDataPresenter.FieldLayoutSettings>
        <igDP:FieldLayoutSettings AutoArrangeMaxRows="0" />
</igDP:XamDataPresenter.FieldLayoutSettings>
----

You can use the above-mentioned code along with the code from link:xamdatapresenter-getting-started-with-xamdatapresenter.html[Adding xamDataPresenter to Your Application]. Simply place the above-mentioned code inside the XamDataPresenter tag. When you run the project, you should see something similar to the following.
