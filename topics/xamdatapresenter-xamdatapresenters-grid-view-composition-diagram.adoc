*1* If labels are in a separate area (i.e. there is a link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.headerpresenter.html[HeaderPresenter]) then you cannot have a link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.cellpresenter.html[CellPresenter]. Instead, the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.cellvaluepresenter.html[CellValuePresenter] is placed directly into the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.datarecordcellarea.html[DataRecordCellArea]. The CellPresenter is used only when labels and cells are together based on the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayoutsettings~labellocation.html[FieldLayoutSettings.LabelLocation] property.
