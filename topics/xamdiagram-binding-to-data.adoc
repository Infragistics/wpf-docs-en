== Binding to Data Sources

=== Supported data sources summary

The  _xamDiagram_   control supports the following data sources:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Data Source|Binding

|Nodes and connections data – reference based
|The data source contains two collections of objects – one representing nodes and the other representing connections. 

Each of the connection objects references its start and end objects. 

The _xamDiagram_ creates a node or connection for each data source object, respectively.

|Nodes and connections data – key based
|The data source contains two collections of objects: 

* Objects representing Nodes 

** Consisting of a single property holding a unique identifier 

* Objects representing Connections 

** Consisting of two properties holding the identifiers of the node object representing the start and end of the connection. 

For each data source object, the control creates a node or connection as applicable in the _xamDiagram_ .

|Hierarchical node data – reference based
|The data source contains a collection of objects that represent nodes. 

Each of these objects can have a collection of objects that are its logical children. For each object in the data source or one of the child collections, _xamDiagram_ creates a node. 

For each parent-child relationship _xamDiagram_ creates a connection.

|Hierarchical node data – key based
|The data source contains a collection of objects that represent nodes. 

Each of the node objects has a property that holds a unique identifier. Each of these objects can have a collection of identifiers that are its logical children. For each object in the data source, a node is created in the _xamDiagram_ . 

For each parent-child relationship _xamDiagram_ creates a connection.

|Mixed
|Any combination of the above. As an example, the data source could contain a number of node objects that each has a child collection of other node objects. In addition, the data source could contain numerous connection objects as well. The resulting diagram displays all the nodes and their logical parent-child connections as well as additional connections for each of the connection objects.

=== Data sources summary

The  _xamDiagram_   receives data through its link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdiagram{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.xamdiagram~itemssource.html[ItemsSource] and link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdiagram{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.xamdiagram~connectionssource.html[ConnectionsSource] properties, which accept any `IEnumerable`. In order to map the input data to nodes and connections in the diagram, three more properties are available – link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdiagram{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.xamdiagram~nodedefinitions.html[NodeDefinitions], link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdiagram{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.xamdiagram~connectiondefinitions.html[ConnectionDefinitions] and link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdiagram{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.xamdiagram~connectionpointdefinitions.html[ConnectionPointDefinitions]. Each of these is a collection of definition objects providing instructions to the diagram about what the data objects represent and how they are interconnected.
