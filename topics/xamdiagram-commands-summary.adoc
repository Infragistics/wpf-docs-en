The  _xamDiagram_   control supports a number of commands which can represent an action performed on diagram items or an interaction with the UI of the control or have some impact on its undo/redo operations history. The commands can be invoked using keyboard shortcuts, interactions with other controls, etc.

Most of the commands are associated to keyboard keys and key combinations according to the existing computing interface standards (like using Ctrl+C for copy, etc.). Keyboard shortcuts (or key combinations) can be overriden programmatically. (For details, see link:xamdiagram-configuring-keyboard-shortcuts.html[Configuring Keyboards Shortcuts]).
