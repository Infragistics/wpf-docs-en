=== Applying styles through code

When applying a style during runtime, after the diagram items and their corresponding Navigation Pane representations have already been loaded, the out of view (virtualized) items will not be affected. There is no way of applying the new shape and color of the Navigation Pane items without iterating all diagram items. As we do not want do that we can suggest (for the users that want to refresh their Navigation Pane items with the proper color) to easily bring all of them into view and again return to their original view section.

Workaround

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
// A theme is applied through code
Rect original = Diagram.WindowRect; // preserve original view state
Diagram.ScaleToFit(); // bring all nodes/connections into view
Diagram.WindowRect = original; // return to original view
----
