The  _xamDiagram_   control exposes the following basic visual elements:

*  *A diagram surface*
*  *Diagram nodes* 
*  *Diagram nodes’ connections* 

The nodes and the connections, collectively known as “diagram items” are rendered within the diagram surface.

Additional visual elements are the:

*  *Navigation pane*  – a reduced-size overview of its full content in a separate pane positioned inside the diagram space, by default at its bottom-right corner. The Navigation pane is implemented through an internal control ( _xamOverviewPlusDetailPane_™)
*  *Toolbox*  – a control that allows adding items to the diagram via drag-and-drop. The Toolbox is implemented through the  _xamDiagramToolbox_™ control.
