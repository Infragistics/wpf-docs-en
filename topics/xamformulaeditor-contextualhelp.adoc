= Contextual Help

== Purpose

This topic introduces you to the contextual help and autocomplete features of the xamFormulaEditor control.

== Required background

You need to first read the following topic:

* link:xamformulaeditor-about.html[About xamFormulaEditor]

== Contextual help types

The content below briefly explains the types of contextual help that the xamFormulaEditor and FormulaEditorDialog display when users enter and edit formulas using the controls.

=== Mouseover help

The mouseover help displays the signature and description of a function when the user moves the mouse over a function’s name and leaves it there for a short delay. If the mouseover help is showing and the user moves the mouse off of the function name, the mouseover help close. 

If a function has one or more arguments, the mouseover help displays the number of arguments defined while hovering over the function name. The same is true for optional arguments;only the provided arguments are displayed in the function signature.

=== Function Signature Help

The function signature help is displayed while the user is typing in a function and they type an open parenthesis '(' or an argument separator ','. The function signature help displays the signature of the function with the current argument highlighted, the description of the function, and a description of the current argument.

=== Autocomplete Item help

The autocomplete item help is displayed only while the autocomplete list is open. If an item remains selected for a short delay, if available, an item description appears. If the item stays selected for longer than 10 seconds, the autocomplete item help will close.
