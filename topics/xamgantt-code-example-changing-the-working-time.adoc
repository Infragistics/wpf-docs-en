== Code Example: Changing the working time

[[_Ref334464968]]

=== Description

The code example below creates a link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.projectcalendar_members.html[ProjectCalendar]. Then, it creates three instances of link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.scheduledayofweek_members.html[ScheduleDayOfWeek] and array of TimeRanges, which is used to specify the working times. Then, it sets new link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.daysettings_members.html[DaySettings] for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, specifying the new working time. Later, a link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.projectcalendarworkweek_members.html[ProjectCalendarWorkWeek] is used in order to state Date range, on which those custom settings will be applied.

In code example is included collection of tasks in order to emphasis better the days with changed working time to those ones with the default working time.

[[_Ref334102005]]

=== Prerequisites

To complete the code example, you should have a xamGantt project . You can follow the instructions in link:xamgantt-adding-xamgantt-to-a-page.html[Adding  _xamGantt_  to a Page] in order to create sample xamGantt project. Then, you must replace the ViewModel and set the ViewModel class, `ProjectViewModel`, show in this topic.

[[_Ref334102013]]

=== Preview

This is a preview of completed sample project. You can see that there are days with different working time. According to code the project calendar should apply for seven days. The screen-shot is taken on application, executed on Monday and the affected days are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for the current week and Monday for the next one.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
If you execute application on other working day, the screen-shot will be slightly different. Besided the dates that will be different, if you execute the application on Tuesday and it is a working day, the affected days will be Tuesday and Wednesday for the current week and Monday and Tuesday for the next one.
