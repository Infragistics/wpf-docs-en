== Configuring Task State as Active/Inactive Using IsActive Property

[[_Ref335260702]]

=== Overview

The `ProjectTask` has two states:

* active
* inactive

By default, the project task state is active.

As long as inactive tasks do not depend on other active tasks, the scheduling engine ignores them.

If a parent task is marked as inactive, all of its children are also deactivated.

The control displays the task in both the  _xamGantt’s_   grid and chart sections.

* In the grid section, the task state appears in the  *Active*  column
* In the chart section, the inactive taskbars are blurred

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Project tasks with actuals (Actual Duration, Actual Finish, Actual Start or % Complete fields have values) cannot be set as inactivate.

=== Property settings
