== Introduction

=== Project class summary

The link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.project_members.html[Project] class is the  _xamGantt_   control’s the primary class.

It manages the data for the project which includes:

* tasks
* resources
* calendars

It has a built-in scheduling engine similar to Microsoft’s Project 2010 engine that adjusts the dates of tasks based on their constraints, deadline, predecessors and successors.

The following table lists some of the main configurable aspects of the  _xamGantt_   `Project`.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|Configurable aspect|Details|Property

|Getting or setting the calendar associated with the project by its unique id
|Identifies or modifies link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.projectcalendar_members.html[ProjectCalendar] associated with the project by id.
| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.project~calendarid.html[CalendarId]

|Getting the calendars associated with the project
|Identifies the collection of `ProjectCalendar` objects associated with the project.
| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.project~calendars.html[Calendars]

|Getting or setting the finish date for a project in Coordinated Universal Time(UTC)
|Identifies or modifies the project finish date in UTC. 

If the scheduling of the project is from its finish date you must set the project finish date. 

The project finish date is a read-only calculated value when scheduling the project from its start date.
| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.project~finish.html[Finish]

|Getting or setting whether the project is calculated from a start or from a finish date
|Identifies or modifies whether the project’s calculations are from the start date.
| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.project~isscheduledfromstart.html[IsScheduledFromStart]

|Getting the resources associated with the project
|Identifies the project’s collection of associated link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.projectresource_members.html[ProjectResource] objects.
| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.project~resourceitems.html[ResourceItems]

|Getting the project root summary task
|Identifies the project’s root task.
| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.project~roottask.html[RootTask]

|Configuring various project settings
|Configures the project settings.
| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.project~settings.html[Settings]

|Getting or setting the start date for a project in Coordinated Universal Time(UTC)
|Identifies or modifies the project’s start date in UTC. 

If the scheduling of the project is from its start date you must set the project start date. 

The project start date is a read-only calculated value when scheduling the project from its finish date.
| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.project~start.html[Start]

|Getting or setting the default settings for all tasks within the project
|Configures project’s default tasks settings.
| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.project~tasksettings.html[TaskSettings]
