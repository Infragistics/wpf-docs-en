|Feature|Description

|Timescale bands
|`Timescale` exposes a collection of link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.timescaleband_members.html[TimescaleBand] objects.The Timescale can have multiple bands. Each timescale band represents set of time intervals.

|Timescale band units
|Timescale bands can display time intervals in various types of units (minutes, hours, days, weeks, thirds of moths, months, quarters, half of years, years).

| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.schedules.xamgantt{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.schedules.timescalebase~scale.html[Scale]
|Scale property of the Timescale controls the percentage by which the preferred size of the intervals will be scaled.

|Timescale band formatting
|You can change the date time format of time shown in the timescale. You can also change the date/time strings alignment.
