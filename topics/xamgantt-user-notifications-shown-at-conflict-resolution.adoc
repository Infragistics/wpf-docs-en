[[_Dependency_Circularities]]

=== Dependency Circularities

If there are dependent tasks and users try to change their references, this may result in creating a circularity chain. There are different warning tooltips displayed depending on the type of circularity chain:

Task cannot be predecessor/successor of itself.

image::images/xamGantt_User_Notifications_shown_at_Conflict_Resolutions_3.png[]

Task cannot be a predecessor and successor of another task.

This warning tooltip is shown when a more complicated circular dependency chain may occur.
