== Adding xamGeographicMap to a Page

[[_Ref320185129]]

=== Introduction

The _xamGeographicMap_ control is designed to display geo-spatial data from shape files and geographic locations from view models on geographic imagery maps. However, this topic focuses on adding the _xamGeographicMap_ control with the minimum code and property settings required for display. By default the _xamGeographicMap_ control is displayed with geographic imagery tiles from Open Street Map service.

=== Preview

The following is a preview of the _xamGeographicMap_ control with geographic imagery tiles from Open Street Map service.

=== Requirements

The following table summarizes the requirements for adding the _xamGeographicMap_ control.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
| *Requirement* | *Description* 

|Prerequisites
|To complete the procedure section of this topic, you need to create a {PlatformName} project.

|Assembly references
|Add the following Infragistics assemblies as references in your project: 

* {ApiPlatform}Controls.Maps.XamGeographicMap.v{ProductVersion}.dll 

* {ApiPlatform}Controls.Charts.XamDataChart.v{ProductVersion}.dll 

* {ApiPlatform}DataVisualization.v{ProductVersion}.dll 

* {ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}.dll

|Data
|The _xamGeographicMap_ control does not require any data for its rendering because it displays geographic imagery tiles from Open Street Map in its background content. However, the _xamGeographicMap_ control can also display geo-spatial data from shape files and geographic locations from view models. Refer to the following topics for more information on how this is accomplished and for data requirements: 

* link:xamgeographicmap-using-geographic-imagery.html[Using Geographic Imagery] 

* link:xamgeographicmap-binding-shape-files-with-geospatial-data.html[Binding Shape Files with Geo-spatial Data] 

* link:xamgeographicmap-binding-geographic-data-models.html[Binding Geographic Data Models]

=== Overview

The following is a conceptual overview of the process:

[start=1]
. *Reference Infragistics assemblies in your project* 
[start=2]
. *Add Infragistics namespaces to your application's view* 
[start=3]
. *Add the Geographic Map control to your application's view* 
[start=4]
. *Verify the results* 

[[_Ref320186502]]

=== Steps

The following procedure takes you step-by-step toward adding the _xamGeographicMap_ control to a page.

=== Reference Infragistics assemblies in your project.

[start=1]
. Right click on your project and select the Add References… menu item.
[start=2]
. In the Add References dialog, browse to and add the following Infragistics assemblies:

* {ApiPlatform}Controls.Maps.XamGeographicMap.v{ProductVersion}.dll

* {ApiPlatform}Controls.Charts.XamDataChart.v{ProductVersion}.dll

* {ApiPlatform}DataVisualization.v{ProductVersion}.dll

* {ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}.dll

=== Add Infragistics namespaces to your application's view.

In the application page, add the following namespace declarations:

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
xmlns:ig="http://schemas.infragistics.com/xaml"
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Imports Infragistics.Controls.Maps
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
using Infragistics.Controls.Maps;
----

=== Add the Geographic Map control to your application's view.

The following code demonstrates adding the _xamGeographicMap_ control with the minimum code and property settings required for display:

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot">
    <ig:XamGeographicMap x:Name="GeoMap" />
</Grid>
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Dim geoMap As New XamGeographicMap()
Me.LayoutRoot.Children.Add(geoMap)
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
var geoMap = new XamGeographicMap();
this.LayoutRoot.Children.Add(geoMap);
----

=== Verify the results.

Build and run your project to verify the result. If you have implemented the steps correctly, the displayed _xamGeographicMap_ should look like the one in the <<_Ref320186496,Preview>> section above.
