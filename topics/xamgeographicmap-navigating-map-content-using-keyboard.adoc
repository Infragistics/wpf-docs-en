|Zoom in map content
|Page Up key
|Pressing the Page Up key on a keyboard, zooms in the map content to the center of the _xamGeographicMap_ control by a scale factor of 0.8. This is equivalent to decreasing values of link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xamgeographicmap~windowscale.html[WindowScale] property.

|Zoom out map content
|Page Down key
|Pressing the Page Down key on a keyboard, zooms out the map content to the center of the _xamGeographicMap_ control by a factor of 1.2 on scale of the map navigation window. This is equivalent to increasing values of link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xamgeographicmap~windowscale.html[WindowScale] property.

|Pan left (west) map content
|Left Arrow key
|Pressing the Left Arrow key on a keyboard, pans left the map content towards left edge (west direction) of the _xamGeographicMap_ control. This is equivalent to decreasing value of the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xamgeographicmap~windowpositionhorizontal.html[WindowPositionHorizontal] property.

|Pan right (east) map content
|Right Arrow key
|Pressing the Right Arrow key on a keyboard, pans right the map content towards right edge (east direction) of the _xamGeographicMap_ control. This is equivalent to increasing value of the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xamgeographicmap~windowpositionhorizontal.html[WindowPositionHorizontal] property.

|Pan up (north) map content
|Up Arrow key
|Pressing the Top Arrow key on a keyboard, pans up the map content towards top edge (north direction) of the _xamGeographicMap_ control. This is equivalent to decreasing value of the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xamgeographicmap~windowpositionvertical.html[WindowPositionVertical] property.

|Pan down (south) map content
|Down Arrow key
|Pressing the Down Arrow key on a keyboard, pans down the map content towards bottom edge (south direction) of the _xamGeographicMap_ control. This is equivalent to increasing value of the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xamgeographicmap~windowpositionvertical.html[WindowPositionVertical] property.

|Scale map content to fit viewable area
|Home key
|Pressing the Home key on a keyboard, fits the map content to the maximum viewable area of the _xamGeographicMap_ control. This is equivalent to setting link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.seriesviewer~windowrect.html[WindowRect] property to a Rect of dimensions: 0, 0, 1, 1
