== Map Navigation

=== Overview

The _xamGeographicMap_ control inherits navigation functionalities from link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.seriesviewer_members.html[SeriesViewer] control which is also used in the  _xamDataChart_   control.

Navigation in the _xamGeographicMap_ control is enabled by default and it allows zooming and panning of the map content. However, this behavior can be changed using the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xamgeographicmap~zoomable.html[Zoomable] property. It is important to know that the _xamGeographicMap_ control allows only synchronized zooming - scaling the map content with preserved aspect ratio. As result, it is not possible to scale the map content vertically without scaling it also horizontally and vice versa.

== Map Navigation Window

In the _xamGeographicMap_ control, navigation window represents currently viewable area of the map content. The link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect] property tracks position and size of the navigation window. Each time panning or zooming operation is performed in the in the _xamGeographicMap_ control, the navigation window changes and the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect] property is updated with new values.

The following table summarizes properties used to track navigation window the in the _xamGeographicMap_ control:

|Property|Type|Description|Default Value

| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect]
| link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.rect.aspx[Rect]
|Indicates position and size of the navigation window which indicates currently viewable area of the map content in the _xamGeographicMap_ control.
|0, 0, 1, 1 

Displays the entire map content in the navigation window.

| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.seriesviewer~actualwindowpositionhorizontal.html[ActualWindowPositionHorizontal]
|double
|Indicates horizontal position of the navigation window’s anchor point from the left edge of the _xamGeographicMap_ control. It is equivalent to value stored in the Left of the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect] property.
|0 

Displays the left portion of the map content in the navigation window.

| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.seriesviewer~actualwindowpositionvertical.html[ActualWindowPositionVertical]
|double
|Indicates vertical position of the navigation window’s anchor point from the top edge of the _xamGeographicMap_ control. It is equivalent to value stored in the Top of the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect] property.
|0 

Displays the top portion of the map content in the navigation window.

| link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xamgeographicmap~actualwindowscale.html[ActualWindowScale]
|double
|Indicates size of the navigation window in of the _xamGeographicMap_ control. It is equivalent to value stored in the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect] property.
|1 

Displays the entire horizontal map content in the navigation window.
