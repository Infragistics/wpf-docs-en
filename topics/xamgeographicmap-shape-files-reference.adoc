= Shape Files Reference

== Topic Overview

=== Purpose

This topic provides resources about maps and geo-spatial related material as well as information about shape files. Use these resources to learn about and obtain shape files as well as tools for their editing before starting to bind geo-spatial data to the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xamgeographicmap_members.html[xamGeographicMap]™ control.

=== Geo-spatial Overview

Before plotting geo-spatial data in the _xamGeographicMap_ control, one should get familiar with the following resources which provide general information about maps and geo-spatial data.

* Wikipedia – Cartography

* National Atlas of the United States – Geographic Locations

=== Shape Files Format

The _xamGeographicMap_ control uses popular link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile#Overview[Shape Files] format as one of the sources for geo-spatial data. Shape files are usually shipped with other file types, generally files with  *.*  *shp* ,  *.*  *shx*  *,*  and  *.dbf*  extensions.

The following table provides basic information and purpose for each type of shape files.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|*File Extension*|*Description*

| *.* *shp* 
|A shape file contains geo-spatial vector data items that describe points, polylines, and polygons. In the shape file, points may describe cities, polylines may describe roads, and polygons may describe shapes of countries in geographic context.

| *.* *shx* 
|A shape index file contains an index for a quick lookup of a geo-spatial vector data items.

| *.dbf* 
|A shape database file contains a table in which a row corresponds to each geo-spatial data item from a shape (.shp) file. In the shape database file, columns may describe attributes for geo-spatial data item such as strings (names of countries, regions, cities) and values (population of countries, location of cities).

Refer to the following resources for detailed information and specifications on how geo-spatial data is stored in shape files.
