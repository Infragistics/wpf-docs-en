=== Features Overview

The following table summarizes the features of the _xamGeographicMap_ control. Additional details are available after the following summary table.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
| *Feature* | *Description* 

|<<_Ref321151536,Geographic Imagery Maps>>
|Provides rendering geographic imagery from Bing Maps™, Open Street Maps, and ArcGIS Maps. Also, it supports creation of maps from other geographic imagery sources such as Map Quest©.

|<<_Ref321151541,Geographic Series>>
|Provides rendering of an unlimited number of geographic series that can display geo-spatial data as points, polylines, and polygons. Multiple geographic series can be used to create a complex layering of map elements; e.g. states, cities, and roads.

|<<_Ref321151550,Shape File Converter>>
|Provides loading geo-spatial data from shape files and converting it to data models that can be bound to geographic series as items sources.

|<<_Ref321151553,Data Binding>>
|Provides data binding to other data sources with geographic data using the data binding and data mapping properties of geographic series.

|<<_Ref321151558,High Performance Rendering>>
|Provides plotting of tens of thousands of data points, and update them every few milliseconds so that the control can handle your real-time feeds.

|<<_Ref321151561,Customizable Shape Templates>>
|Provides customizable shape templates that can be styled conditionally based on data values.

|<<_Ref321151565,Customizable Marker Templates>>
|Provides customizable marker templates for displaying geographic locations as cities, airports, earthquakes, or points of interest.

|<<_Ref321151568,Map Navigation>>
|Provides customizable navigation behaviors for navigating map content using mouse, keyboard, or code-behind.

=== Geographic Series

The _xamGeographicMap_ control’s link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdatachart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.seriesviewer~series.html[Series] property is used to support rendering an unlimited number of geographic series. This property is a collection of geographic series objects and any type of geographic series can be added to it. For example, link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.geographicsymbolseries_members.html[GeographicSymbolSeries] can be added for plotting geographic locations such as cities and the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.geographicpolylineseries_members.html[GeographicPolylineSeries] for plotting connections (e.g. roads) between these geographic locations.

=== Shape File Converter

In the _xamGeographicMap_ control, the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] class loads geo-spatial data from shape files and converts it to a collection of link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.shapefilerecord_members.html[ShapefileRecord] objects. Geographic series can be bound to this collection and render geo-spatial data.

=== Data Binding

In addition to rendering data from shape files and geographic imagery maps, the _xamGeographicMap_ control also provides data binding to other data sources with geographic data using the data binding and data mapping properties of geographic series.

The following is a preview of the _xamGeographicMap_ control with link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.geographicsymbolseries_members.html[GeographicSymbolSeries] bound to a data model that contains locations of some cities of the world.

=== High Performance Rendering

The _xamGeographicMap_ control provides plotting of tens of thousands of data points, and updates them every few milliseconds so that the control can handle your real-time feeds.

The following is a preview of the _xamGeographicMap_ control with link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xamgeographicmap{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.geographicsymbolseries_members.html[GeographicSymbolSeries] bound to a data source with hundreds of data points.
