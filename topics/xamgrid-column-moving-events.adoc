= Column Moving Events

There are five events associated with column moving in xamGrid™. The column moving events allow you to perform some custom business logic before, during or after a column has moved.

* link:{ApiPlatform}controls.grids.xamgrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.grids.xamgrid~columndragstart_ev.html[ColumnDragStart] – The moment right before a drag operation is performed on a column, the ColumnDragStart event fires.
* link:{ApiPlatform}controls.grids.xamgrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.grids.xamgrid~columnmoving_ev.html[ColumnMoving] – This event fires while dragging a column.
* link:{ApiPlatform}controls.grids.xamgrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.grids.xamgrid~columndropped_ev.html[ColumnDropped] – This event fires when a column has been successfully moved to a new position.
* link:{ApiPlatform}controls.grids.xamgrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.grids.xamgrid~columndragcanceled_ev.html[ColumnDragCanceled] – This event is fired when a drag operation is cancelled.
* link:{ApiPlatform}controls.grids.xamgrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.grids.xamgrid~columndragended_ev.html[ColumnDragEnded] – This event is fired when a drag operation is completed, regardless if it was successful or not.

These events allow you to control how your end user interacts with the column moving feature. For example you can cancel the ColumnDragStart event which would not allow your end users to move that column.
