= Row Selector Events

There is one event associated with row selectors in xamGrid™. This event allows you to perform some custom business logic after the row selector is clicked.

link:{ApiPlatform}controls.grids.xamgrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.grids.xamgrid~rowselectorclicked_ev.html[RowSelectorClicked] - The event fires after the row selector is clicked.

You can use this event to determine which row the row selector was clicked on.
