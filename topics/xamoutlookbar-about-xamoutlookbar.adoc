= About xamOutlookBar

The xamOutlookBar™ control emulates the navigation bar found in Microsoft® Outlook®. Just as Outlook separates email-related functionality from calendar-related functionality, you can organize your own application tasks into subsets of related tasks. The xamOutlookBar control has the following features:

* *Groups* - Each group is a headered content control that can host a diverse set of controls.
* *Collapsible* - Your end users can collapse xamOutlookBar to maximize screen real estate.

See the table below for a description of each item (e.g., field, drop-down list, link) in the smart tag, as well as the item's corresponding property in the properties window.
