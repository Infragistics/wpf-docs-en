== Binding to Data Sources

[[_Ref319429756]]

=== Supported data sources summary

Data sources provide access to and manipulation of data and they instruct xamPivotGrid and xamPivotDataSelector™ controls how to use the data that you want to analyze.

The xamPivotGrid control supports the following data sources:

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|Data source|Data Source ViewModel|Binding

|SQL Server Analysis Server
| link:xampivotgrid-databinding-using-xmladatasource.html[XmlaDataSource]
|Represents a controller for connecting and executing queries against SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) through XML for Analysis (XMLA) model provider.

ifdef::wpf[]
|SQL Server Analysis Server
| link:xampivotgrid-us-connecting-to-an-adomd-net-datasource.html[AdomdDataSource]
|Represents a controller for connecting and executing queries directly against SQL Server Analysis Services.
endif::wpf[]

|SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse
| link:xampivotgrid-databinding-using-sap-xmla-datasource.html[XmlaSapDataSource]
|Represents a controller that provides a way to connect and execute queries against SAS through XMLA.

|Oracle Essbase
| link:xampivotgrid-connecting-to-an-oracle-xmla-datasource.html[XmlaOracleDataSource]
|Represents a controller that provides a way to connect and execute queries against Essbase for Oracle through XMLA.

|IEnumerable data collection
| link:xampivotgrid-databinding-using-flatdatasource.html[FlatDataSource]
|Represents a controller that provides a way to use `System.Collections.IEnumerable` as data source to display data in the xamPivotGrid control.

[[_Ref319429760]]

=== Data sources summary

All data sources listed above inherit from the link:{ApiPlatform}olap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.olap.datasourcebase_members.html[DataSourceBase] class which implements the link:{ApiPlatform}olap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.olap.iolapviewmodel_members.html[IOlapViewModel] interface. These classes serve as a link between the actual data source (for example the server where the olap cube is stored) on one side and the xamPivotGrid on the other side. In order to use the xamPivotGrid control with your existing data you will need to use one of these ViewModels. However, if these data sources are insufficient, advanced users can create a custom view model with a data provider by implementing the `IOlapViewModel` interface or inheriting from the `DataSourceBase` class.

=== Binding class diagram

The following class diagram is a simplified model of how data binding works for the xamPivotGrid control.

=== Components for the Data Binding

There are several components that are most commonly used when binding data to the xamPivotGrid. For more details, refer to the table below.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|Component|Required?|Description

| link:xampivotgrid-understanding-xampivotgrid.html[xamPivotGrid]
|Yes
|The control that displays the data.

| link:xampivotgrid-dataselector.html[xamPivotDataSelector]
|No
|Represents the xamPivotDataSelector control for selecting and manipulating data displayed in the xamPivotGrid control.

|DataSource
|Yes
|Represents a view model that implements `IOlapViewModel` interface and controls the data through the xamPivotGrid control’s link:{ApiPlatform}controls.grids.xampivotgrid.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.grids.xampivotgrid~datasource.html[DataSource] and the xamPivotDataSelector control’s link:{ApiPlatform}controls.grids.xampivotgrid.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.grids.xampivotdataselector~datasource.html[DataSource] properties.

|====

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
As stated above this is the most common usage scenario. However there also some other cases. For example, a xamPivotDataSelector can be used together with a data source without using the xamPivotGrid to display the data.

|This sample shows how to use the XMLA data source. XamPivotGrid is also introducing a new property called "IsBusy". When the control is loading data the IsBusy property is evaluated against the duration of processing the data. This allows the user to display some progress indicator while in progress of processing data. This is how it is done in this sample. See the code (.cs or .vb) from the Code View drop-down.
