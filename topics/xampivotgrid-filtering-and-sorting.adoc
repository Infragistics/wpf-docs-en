|Sorting in the xamPivotGrid control can be configured on two levels – grid wide and column wide. Sorting is enabled for all columns by default. Each header cell has a sorting indicator with three states: Ascending, Descending, and Not Sorted. The end user can click on it to trigger sorting.

|This sample shows how to manipulate filters programmatically (Click on the Filter button). You could also filter the data by drag a dimension to the filters area. The dimension items in the UI have a menu that you could open and use to filter data. Try dragging the City hierarchy to the Filter Field Area for example.
