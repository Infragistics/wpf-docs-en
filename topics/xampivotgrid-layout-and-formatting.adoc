= Layouts and Formatting (xamPivotGrid)

=== Introduction

The xamPivotGrid™ control provides different ways to organize the layout and format of the data that is displayed.

=== Topics

Detailed information regarding layout and formatting in the xamPivotGrid™ is covered in the following topics:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Topic|Purpose

| link:xampivotgrid-us-compact-layout.html[Compact Layout]
|The CompactLayout feature of the xamPivotGrid effectively truncates the tree structure of the headers and frees the space for important information to appear. This topic explains how to use the feature.

| link:xampivotgrid-customizing-cells-with-templates.html[Customizing Cells with Templates]
|The xamPivotGrid control provides the ability to specify custom DataTemplates for data and header cells. You can specify different templates for different cells based on what hierarchy, level, etc. the cell is in.

| link:xampivotgrid-us-conditional-formating.html[Conditional Formating]
|The xamPivotGrid control allows you to perform value based (conditional) formatting through its CellControlAttached event, which has some special characteristics. This topic explains how you can take advantage of this feature and provides a code example.

| link:xampivotgrid-us-column-resizing.html[Column Resizing]
|The xamPivotGrid control allows the user to change the width of the columns. This resizing behavior can be easily customized through a number of properties and a couple of events.
