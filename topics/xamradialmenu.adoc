=== Introduction

This section contains topics covering the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.menus.xamradialmenu{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.menus.xamradialmenu.html[ _xamRadialMenu_  ]™ control for {ProductName}.

The  _xamRadialMenu_   control is essentially a context menu presenting its items in a circular arrangement around a center button. The circular arrangement of the items speeds up items selection, because each item is equally positioned in relation to the center. The  _xamRadialMenu_   supports different item types for choosing numerical values, color values or performs actions. Sub-Items are also supported.
