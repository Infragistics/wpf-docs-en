= Add an Image to the Application Menu



When you create a basic xamRibbon using Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), the Application Menu is one of the few xamRibbon™ components that is always visible by default. You may wish to enhance this area of xamRibbon by displaying an image inside the Application Menu button. Typically, this image would be a company logo or application icon.

The following example code demonstrates how to add an image to the application menu.
