= Separator



The Separator tool is a line that visually separates and organizes tools within an application menu, or menu tool. The Separator tool derives from Microsoft® Windows® Presentation Foundation's System.Windows.Controls.Separator class; therefore, you get all the same functionality as a standard .NET Framework Separator control.

Unlike the other Ribbon tools, the Separator tool is not meant for displaying application task to the end user; therefore, the Separator tool does not respond to user interaction. In addition, the Separator tool does not provide any of the common Ribbon tool properties found on tools such as the Button tool.
