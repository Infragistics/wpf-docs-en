== Introduction

=== TabItem area toolbar summary

The  _xamRibbon_   control allows you to create a toolbar located next to the tabs. This toolbar extends from the `ItemsControl` class allowing you to add any kind of content in it.

This toolbar is located on the line where the tab items are placed aligned to the right. If there is not enough space to render all of the toolbar’s content, some of it will be hidden and an overflow button will be rendered on the right. Clicking this button will open a popup containing all hidden toolbar content.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
If you want to determine at what width toolbar items will begin to be hidden you can specify the minimum width to reserve for the tab items on the left via the `TabItemAreaMinWidth` property.

The following screenshot demonstrates a  _xamRibbon_   control with the tab item area toolbar:

The following screenshot demonstrates a  _xamRibbon_   control with the overflow popup shown. The items in the popup were hidden from the toolbar due to the limited space, which prevented the whole toolbar’s content from being rendered next to the tab items:

You have to instantiate it and set it to the xamRibbon’s link:{ApiPlatform}ribbon{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.ribbon.tabitemareatoolbar_members.html[TabItemAreaToolbar] property. The `TabItemAreaToolbar` class provides several properties for configuring the toolbar, which are explained in the table below.
