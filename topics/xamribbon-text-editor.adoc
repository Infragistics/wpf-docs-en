= Text Editor



If you need a simple text editor, then the TextEditor tool is the right tool for you. The TextEditor tool derives from the Infragistics.Windows.Editors.XamTextEditor class; therefore, you get all the functionality that xamTextEditor offers.

The TextEditor tool also implements the IRibbonTool interface, which adds cloning and binding functionality to facilitate advanced xamRibbon™ features. If you aren't creating your own custom xamRibbon tool, you don't need to worry about the `IRibbonTool` interface.

The link:{ApiPlatform}ribbon.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.ribbon.texteditortool.html[TextEditorTool] class exposes several extra properties that go a long way towards easily managing a text editor on xamRibbon. TextEditorTool exposes several 'Has' and 'Is' properties to help confirm if a property has been set or if the text editor is in a certain state. A few of the standard properties that help set up a TextEditor tool (or any tool) on xamRibbon include:

* link:{ApiPlatform}ribbon.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.ribbon.texteditortool~caption.html[Caption] - This text will always be visible next to the TextEditor tool regardless of the current SizingMode property value.
* link:{ApiPlatform}ribbon.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.ribbon.texteditortool~id.html[Id] - An identification string that xamRibbon uses to associate tools when they're located in different locations (i.e. a Ribbon Group and the Quick Access Toolbar simultaneously). The Id isn't required, but it can help you link:xamribbon-access-a-tool-by-its-id.html[access a tool] at run time.
* link:{ApiPlatform}ribbon.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.ribbon.texteditortool~keytip.html[KeyTip] - Each tool has a link:xamribbon-key-tips.html[Key Tip] (similar to main menu mnemonics) associated with it. If you don't provide one explicitly, xamRibbon will internally choose one for you.
* link:{ApiPlatform}ribbon.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.ribbon.texteditortool~largeimage.html[LargeImage] - Usually a 32 x 32 pixel image. You'll see this image when a tool's SizingMode is set to ImageAndTextLarge.
* link:{ApiPlatform}ribbon.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.ribbon.texteditortool~sizingmode.html[SizingMode] - This property is read-only and returns how the tool is currently sized on its associated Ribbon group. If you want to link:xamribbon-resize-a-tool.html[set the size of a tool], you can set the RibbonGroup's link:{ApiPlatform}ribbon.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.ribbon.ribbongroup~minimumsizeproperty.html[MinimumSize] and/or link:{ApiPlatform}ribbon.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.ribbon.ribbongroup~maximumsizeproperty.html[MaximumSize] attached properties.
* link:{ApiPlatform}ribbon.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.ribbon.texteditortool~smallimage.html[SmallImage] - Usually a 16 x 16 pixel image. You'll see this image when a tool's SizingMode is set to ImageAndTextNormal or ImageOnly.

Since xamRibbon tools all derive from and implement the same objects, the functionality for each of them is very similar. The following topics apply to all xamRibbon tools.
