== Adding a Trend Line

=== Overview

The trend line displays in the  _xamSparkline_   control as another layer on top of the Sparkline layer. To display a trend line, use the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamsparkline{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.xamsparkline~trendlinetype.html[TrendLineType] property.

The trend lines are calculated according to the algorithm specified by the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamsparkline{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.xamsparkline~trendlinetype.html[TrendLineType] property using the values of the data that the chart is bound to. The supported trend lines are listed and explained in the xamSparkline Overview topic.

Trend line types can be displayed only one at a time. (No multiple trend lines can be displayed simultaneously.)

By default, the trend line is not displayed.

=== Specifying the trend line type

The following table maps the  _xamSparkline_   trend line types to the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamsparkline{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.xamsparkline~trendlinetype.html[TrendLineType] property settings that deliver them.

=== Code Example

The following code demonstrates setting of the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamsparkline{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.xamsparkline~trendlinetype.html[TrendLineType] property to QuinticFit.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<igSparkline:XamSparkline TrendLineType="QuinticFit"/>
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
this.xamSparkline1.TrendLineType = SparklineTrendType.CuinticFit;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Me.xamSparkline1.TrendLineType = SparklineTrendType.CuinticFit
----

=== Configuring the Trend Line

The Trend Line can be configured in the following aspects:

* Trend line type
* Trend line period
* Trend line color
* Trend line thickness

For details on how to configure the trend lines, refer to the link:xamsparkline-configuring-the-trend-line.html[Configuring the Trend Line] topic.
