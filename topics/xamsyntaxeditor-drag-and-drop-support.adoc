== Introduction

[[_Ref331751697]]

=== Description

The  _xamSyntaxEditor_   supports both internal (within the document) and external (between applications) text selection drag and drop.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Due to limitations in Silverlight, the  _xamSyntaxEditor_   does not support dragging to a drop target that is external to the control or dropped on from an external source.

[[_Ref331751708]]

=== Dragging selection

When moving the mouse over a text selection, the mouse cursor shows if the selection supports dragging. An arrow mouse pointer means that the selection supports dragging while an I-Beam mouse pointer means that the text selection does not support dragging.

This table shows the mouse cursors and their meaning:

[[_Ref331751715]]

=== Dropping selection

When dragging a selection, the mouse pointer shows whether it is possible to drop the selection at the current mouse position. The default drag operation will move the text selection to the new place; however, if the user presses the CTRL key, a “+” sign appears in the mouse cursor indicating that the drag operation will copy the text selection leaving the current text selection intact.

This table shows the mouse cursors and their meaning:
