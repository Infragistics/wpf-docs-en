=== IME support summary

The  _xamSyntaxEditor_   control supports OS native language input directly in the editor. If you have installed an Asian language input method on your system, the  _xamSyntaxEditor_   control will display input method compositions and candidate lists directly in the control’s editing area, and immediately re-flow surrounding text as the composition changes.

The following screenshot shows an active Japanese language input composition in the  _xamSyntaxEditor_   using Hiragana as well as the dropdown list of candidates for the current composition:
