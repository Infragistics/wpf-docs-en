== Introduction

=== Introduction to the xamSyntaxEditor

The  _xamSyntaxEditor_   is a cross platform control providing a link:xamsyntaxeditor-editing-support-overview.html[code editing] experience similar to Microsoft’s Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) code window.

The  _xamSyntaxEditor_   provides you with the ability to display and edit the text contained in a link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.textdocument.html[TextDocument] class. The `TextDocument` class exposes properties, methods and events for loading, saving and manipulating the contained text. There are no limitations on the size of the text contained in the `TextDocument`.

The `TextDocument` class uses highly optimized lexing and parsing algorithms that allow the  _xamSyntaxEditor_   control to provide link:xamsyntaxeditor-syntax-highlighting.html[syntax highlighting], (using text colorization) and link:xamsyntaxeditor-error-reporting.html[error highlighting] (using squiggly underlines as in Visual Studio) based on link:xamsyntaxeditor-supported-languages.html[predefined language definitions]. Where possible, perform time-consuming operations, such as lexing and parsing on-demand and in background threads, which allows you to display very large documents very quickly.
