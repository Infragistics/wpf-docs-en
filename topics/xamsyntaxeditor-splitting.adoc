== Introduction

=== Splitting summary

The  _xamSyntaxEditor_   supports splitting of the editing area (either horizontally or vertically). When enabled, the user may use this feature for a visual comparison of two parts of the edited document and make changes to both of them. You can configure which splitting is available to the user (see the table below). In addition, there is a property, which can be used to determine the current splitting status of the  _xamSyntaxEditor’s_   editing area.

The screenshot below shows the  _xamSyntaxEditor’s_   split handles:

== Obtain/Set the Current Splitting Status

=== Overview

You can obtain and set the current splitting status and see if and how the user has split the editing area.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to property settings.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Use this property:|And:

|Obtain the current splitting
|`SplitStatus`
|Read its value

|Set the current splitting
|`SplitStatus`
|Set it to a value of type link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xamsyntaxeditor{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.editordocumentviewsplitstatus.html[EditorDocumentViewSplitStatus]

|====

=== Code

The following code example shows how to obtain the current split status:

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
if (this.xamSyntaxEditor1.SplitStatus ==
    EditorDocumentViewSplitStatus.SplitHorizontally)
{
    // do something
}
else if (this.xamSyntaxEditor1.SplitStatus ==
    EditorDocumentViewSplitStatus.SplitVertically)
{
    // do something else
}
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
If Me.xamSyntaxEditor1.SplitStatus = _
    EditorDocumentViewSplitStatus.SplitHorizontally Then
        ' do something
ElseIf Me.xamSyntaxEditor1.SplitStatus = _
    EditorDocumentViewSplitStatus.SplitVertically Then
        ' do something else
End If
----

The following code example shows how to set the current split to vertical:

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
this.xamSyntaxEditor1.SplitStatus = EditorDocumentViewSplitStatus.SplitVertically;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Me.xamSyntaxEditor1.SplitStatus = EditorDocumentViewSplitStatus.SplitVertically
----
