== Introduction

=== Introduction to Syntax Highlighting

The  _xamSyntaxEditor™_   supports syntax highlighting, which are visual cues for interpreting the text shown in the editor. Interpreting the manner in which various parts of the text is a function of the language set in the link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.textdocument~language.html[Language] property of the `TextDocument`. The syntax-highlighting feature uses text colorization for different text parts (for example. comments, keywords, etc …). Errors are rendered highlighted and with squiggly underlines to help identify text that is not complying within the language syntax rules.

There are several predefined languages supported in the `TextDocument` assembly:

* link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.plaintextlanguage_members.html[PlainTextLanguage]
* link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument.csharp{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.csharplanguage_members.html[CSharpLanguage]
* link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument.visualbasic{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.visualbasiclanguage_members.html[VisualBasicLanguage]
* link:{ApiPlatform}documents.textdocument.tsql{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.parsing.tsqllanguage_members.html[TSqlLanguage]

The following screenshot shows the  _xamSyntaxEditor_   control displaying C# code with syntax highlighting applied based on the C# language:
