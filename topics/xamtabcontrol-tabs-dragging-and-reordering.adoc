== Introduction

=== Dragging and reordering summary

The link:{ApiPlatform}v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.controls.xamtabcontrol.html[ _xamTabControl_  ] allows the user to reorder the tabs by dragging them at a new position. This feature is disabled by default. The following screenshot demonstrates the process of moving the "Page Layout" tab to a new location between the "References" and "Mailing" tabs.

== Tab Dragging Configuration Summary

=== Tab dragging configuration summary

The tab dragging feature supports two modes of tab dragging:

*  *Deferred*  – while dragging a tab its new position is indicated by a floating representation and two insertion arrows.
*  *Immediate*  – while dragging a tab, the whole tab area is constantly reordered to visualize the new tab position.

.Note
[NOTE]
====

If the tab dragging mode is set to  *Immediate*  it will resolve to  *Deferred*  in case the tabs are rendered on multiple rows.
====

.Note
[NOTE]
====

The tab dragging is not possible if the `ItemsSource` property is set to a read-only collection.
