== Selection Summary

=== Selection summary

The link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.xamtreegrid.html[xamTreeGrid] control allows you to configure (via property) which records are selected in response to a user selecting a range of records or cells. The three cases below have the same initial state:

* No initial selection
* The "Documents" record is expanded
* The "Users" record is collapsed
* The user performs cross-level selection by clicking on the "Boot" record selector and then shift-clicks on the "Windows" record selector
* After the selection is done the user expands the "Users" record

==== "Single" Depth Selection Mode

In this case no nested records are selected regardless of the expanded state of their parent record. Only records on the current selection level are selected. This is the default setting for GridView.

==== "VisibleOnly" Depth Selection Mode

image::images/xamTreeGrid_06.png[]

In this case all visible records between the pivot record and the end selection record are selected. The records under the "Users" record were not selected because they became visible after the selection was made. This is the default setting for TreeView.

==== "All" Depth Selection Mode

In this case all records (at the selection level and all nested levels) were selected regardless of the expanded state of their parent.

=== Selection configuration summary

The following table explains briefly the configurable aspect of the  _xamTreeGrid_   control and maps it to the property that configure it.
