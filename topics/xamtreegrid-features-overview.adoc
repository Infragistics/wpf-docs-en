== Introduction

=== XamTreeGrid summary

The link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.xamtreegrid.html[xamTreeGrid] is a control from the Data Presenter family which arranges data in a tree grid layout. Essentially the control is a link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.xamdatapresenter.html[xamDataPresenter] that implements a single view (a link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.treeview.html[TreeView]) which cannot by dynamically switched.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
If you need dynamically view switching you should use the  _xamDataPresenter_   and attach the required a link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.viewbase.html[ViewBase] derived class to the View property.
====

The  _xamTreeGrid_   control is similar to the  _xamDataGrid_   in many aspects like data binding, field definition, events, commanding etc. This set of topics will describe the differences you need to know comparing to the  _xamDataGrid_  . This said it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the concept and topics listed in the "Required Background" section.

Like the  _xamDataGrid_  , the  _xamTreeGrid_   has a view extending from the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.gridviewbase.html[GridViewBase] and because of this it lays out data out in columns and rows. There is an important addition however – one field is designated as the tree field. This is a field which contains a tree representation of the hierarchical data bound to the control. You have the ability to browse thought the nested records' levels by expanding and collapsing them using the designated expansion indicators.

The following screenshot shows the  _xamTreeGrid_   control displaying hierarchical structure of records with the tree positioned in the "Name" field. The "Name" field in this example is using a custom template for the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.treecellvaluepresenter.html[TreeCellValuePresenter] which displays an image for each record:
