|Limitation|Description|Status

|Adding records not supported
|The _xamTreeGrid_ control does not provide a UI for adding records therefore the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayoutsettings~allowaddnew.html[AllowAddNew] property of link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayoutsettings.html[FieldLayoutSettings] is ignored.
|image::images/No.png[]

|Expandable field records not supported
|The _xamTreeGrid_ control does not support expandable field records as the _xamDataGrid_ . Instead it supports expandable records which are rendered using a single field layout. Because of this all properties which begin with "ExpandableFieldRecord…" of the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.datapresenterbase~fieldsettings.html[FieldSettings] object have no effect on the control.
|image::images/No.png[]

|Grouping not suppotrted
|The _xamTreeGrid_ control does not support grouping records, therefore all of the "GroupBy…" properties are ignored.
|image::images/No.png[]

|Label location in cells not supported
|A setting of link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.labellocation.html[InCells] for the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayoutsettings~labellocation.html[LabelLocation] property of `FieldLayoutSettings` will resolve to `SeperateHeader`.
|image::images/No.png[]

|UseCollectionView filtering not supported
|The _xamTreeGrid_ control does not support the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.filterevaluationmode.html[UseCollectionView] filtering option for the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.fieldlayoutsettings~filterevaluationmode.html[FilterEvaluationMode] property. If you set the `UseCollectionView` option this will resolve to `Auto`.
