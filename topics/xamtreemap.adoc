Treemaps display hierarchical (tree-structured) data as a set of nested nodes. Each branch of the tree is given a treemap node, which is then tiled with smaller nodes representing sub-branches. Each node's rectangle has an area proportional to a specified dimension on the data. Often the nodes are colored to show a separate dimension of the data.

When the color and size dimensions are correlated in some way with the tree structure, one can often easily see patterns that would be difficult to spot in other ways. A second advantage of treemaps is that, by construction, they make efficient use of space. As a result, they can legibly display thousands of items on the screen simultaneously.

Treemaps are not designed to convey numerical quantities; the intent is to show relative rankings. Treemaps can be more effective than pie charts and other forms of area charts that often do a poor job of classifying data points and communicating the relative differences of their values.

The xamTreemap control is a treemap that displays the relative weight of data. It uses a variety of algorithms to help it determine how the layout of its data items should occur:

* Slice and Dice
* Squarified
* Strip

The xamTreemap control allows customers to choose the algorithm that is best for their requirements, defaulting to use the Squarified method. The control includes the ability to allow customers to colorize nodes using two mechanisms, first a group-based meachism that colors items with like values, second a scale-based mechanism similar to a map choropleth, which gradiates node colors based on their value.

The control is capable of binding to and rendering tens of thousands of data point nodes.
