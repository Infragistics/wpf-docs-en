= Supported Geo-Imagery

The xamMap™ control provides support for rendering geographical imagery. The control’s link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xammap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xammap~maptilesource.html[MapTileSource] property is used to configure the source from which geo-imagery is loaded. Using the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.maps.xammap.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.controls.maps.xammap.html[XamMap] control, you can also display different layer types of geo-imagery; for more information please see link:xamwebmap-display-different-layer-types.html[Display Different Layer Types]. Currently, geo-imagery is supported from the following external geo-imagery sources:
